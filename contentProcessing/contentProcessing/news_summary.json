        "body": "Even More Evidence That Alzheimer's Was Being Spread by Now-Banned Injections Health 30 January 2024 By Felicity Nelson (JohnnyGreig/Getty Images) The practice of injecting children with growth hormone extracted from the brains of deceased people was abandoned long ago \u2013 with good reason. Around 200 children who underwent this procedure during 1959\u20131985 to treat short stature developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease decades later \u2013 a deadly , degenerative brain condition caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. Now, a study has provided more evidence that these injections might also have seeded Alzheimer's disease. Such person-to-person transmissions of Alzheimer's disease would be extremely rare as they require direct contact with brain fluid. But instruments used in neurosurgery should be decontaminated to avoid transferring Alzheimer's proteins between patients, the researchers say . Standard sanitization techniques like boiling, drying, or soaking in formaldehyde don't remove prions. Neurologist John Collinge from the University College London Institute of Prion Diseases and his colleagues have suspected for some time that injections of pituitary-derived growth hormone from cadavers might have transmitted dementia. They've been keeping an eye on referrals to the United Kingdom's National Prion Clinic to see whether signs of cognitive impairment arise in people who had these cadaver injections but didn't die from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The team reports that five out of eight people given these now-banned injections as children developed symptoms consistent with Alzheimer's disease in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Of the remaining three people in the study, one had mild cognitive impairment, one had cognitive symptoms, and the other was asymptomatic. The retrospective nature of the study was such that everyone underwent a different series of tests. However, there was evidence of Alzheimer's biomarkers and brain atrophy across the cohort that was suggestive of the disease. The presence of early-onset dementia in these people couldn't be easily explained by other factors, such as childhood intellectual disability, cranial radiotherapy, underlying medical conditions, or growth hormone deficiency, the authors reasoned . The results build on a previous study showing that archival samples of these hormone injections contained amyloid beta \u2013 the protein thought to be the causative agent behind Alzheimer's disease. In an autopsy study, people who had received these injections and had subsequently died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were found to have amyloid beta deposits in their brains . We don't know for sure what causes Alzheimer's disease. This body of research is radical in that it suggests that Alzheimer's disease is prion-like, with seeds of degenerate proteins triggering a chain reaction throughout the brain. This would place Alzheimer's disease in the same category as other prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) and kuru , a brain disease that was related to the ritualistic consumption of deceased people in Papua New Guinea, a practice that ended in the late 1950s. \"The extent to which prion-like mechanisms are involved in Alzheimer's pathogenesis may have important bearings on therapeutic strategies,\" write the researchers. This research has been published in Nature Medicine .",

        "body": "First-Ever Footage of a Newborn Great White Shark Has Scientists in a Frenzy Nature 30 January 2024 By Clare Watson (Carlos Gauna/The Malibu Artist) A wildlife filmmaker and biology student have recorded something scientists have long been searching for: the first-ever glimpse of a newborn great white shark. The young pup was spotted several hundred meters off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, in July last year in some mesmerizing drone footage captured by filmmaker Carlos Gauna. With its two black eyes poking out above the ocean surface and its milk-white body below, it could be mistaken for a dugong or manatee. But its protruding snout, sleek body, and angular caudal fin cannot be confused for anything other than a white shark. White sharks ( Carcharodon carcharias ), also known as great white sharks, are typically gray on top with a lighter, white underbelly. Pregnant females produce 'uterine milk', a yellowish and milky fluid for embryos to consume. Guana had seen several seemingly pregnant sharks in the same area just days before the sighting. So the bright white shark immediately stood out to him when it surfaced. \"On this day, one of them dove down, and not long afterwards, this fully white shark appears,\" says Gauna, who goes by The Malibu Artist online. \"It's not a stretch to deduce where the baby came from.\" You can see the footage for yourself in the video below at around the 7:30 mark. The pregnant-looking mother shark disappears into darker waters, and in the next shot, a slim pale-white shark emerges from the glass-green sea. frameborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen> The sighting has yet to be confirmed as a newborn white shark, although Gauna and coauthor Phillip Sternes, a shark biologist at the University of California Riverside, have published their findings in a peer-reviewed journal, describing how the pup might have been days or even hours old given its appearance. What's more, the finding adds to earlier reports from 2020 of the smallest known white shark, just one meter long and thought to be a newborn, which was caught off the Pacific coast near the US-Mexico border. \"There are a lot of hypothetical areas, but despite intense interest in these sharks, no one's seen a birth or a newborn pup in the wild,\" says Sternes. \"This may well be the first evidence we have of a pup in the wild, making this a definitive birthing location.\" It's not uncommon for the observations of budding naturalists or citizen scientists to find their way into the scientific literature. In fact, lucky sightings are a crucial part of scientific exploration and discovery that expands our understanding of the world. In this case, the shark's diminutive size and rounded fins, resembling those of near-term shark embryos, suggest it was born not long before the drone came along. Gauna and Sternes also noticed that the whitish film sloughed off as the animal swam. \"I believe it was a newborn white shark shedding its embryonic layer,\" says Sternes. Another view of the pale white shark. ( Carlos Gauna ) There are other possible explanations we should consider, though. The shark could have an unknown skin disorder that results in the animal shedding skin, or be covered in some whitish microbial growth. It might also be a rare case of albinism. But the timing of this shark surfacing not long after a pregnant-looking shark descended, and the patchy coloration on its pectoral fins, does seem compelling. If the same individual can be spotted again, comparisons could be made to see how its skin has changed over time and how much it has grown. From their footage, Sternes and Gauna estimate the pup measured about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long, which is in the range of juvenile white sharks. \"Further research is needed to confirm these waters are indeed a great white breeding ground,\" Sternes says . \"But if it does, we would want lawmakers to step in and protect these waters to help white sharks keep thriving.\" The findings have been published in Environmental Biology of Fishes .",

        "body": "Scientists Think They're on The Verge of Breaching The Blood-Brain Barrier Health 29 January 2024 By Carly Cassella Red fluorescent proteins in brain cells. (Emily Han) The human brain is the body's most protected organ, and for good reason. To keep our body's 'control center' safe from pathogens and toxins, the brain and spinal cord sit in privileged exclusion from the rest of the body. But this ivory tower also poses a significant barrier to medicine. Today, virtually all large molecule drugs and more than 98 percent of small molecule drugs in the human bloodstream are unable to enter the central nervous system because of a 'locked gate' known as the blood-brain barrier . Scientists say they are now closer than ever to smuggling important treatments through. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have put together a simple model of the blood-brain barrier in the lab, allowing them to test the best drug transporters. Specifically, the team is studying the delivery of fat-soluble 'packages', called lipid nanoparticles, which can pass through the blood-brain barrier and carry proteins, antibodies , or even messenger RNA with them. This lipid packaging is what allows the mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 to enter the body's cells as well. mRNA therapies hold great potential in treating neurological disease, as they can theoretically be used to replace missing proteins or edit faulty genes in the brain. But first, we have to get them there. \"Our model performed better at crossing the blood-brain barrier than others and helped us identify organ-specific particles that we later validated in future models,\" explains bioengineer Michael Mitchell. \"It's an exciting proof of concept that will no doubt inform novel approaches to treating conditions like traumatic brain injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's .\" Such treatments are desperately needed. Excluding medicines that treat affective disorders, like antidepressants, some estimates suggest as few as one percent of all available drugs are active in the central nervous system. To get around the blood-brain barrier, some drugs are directly injected into the brain, but this procedure is highly invasive, and the medicine does not diffuse easily throughout the organ, limiting its treatment scope. In 2015, scientists used sound waves to allow chemotherapy drugs past the blood-brain barrier for the first time, spurring ongoing clinical trials. But this newest study takes a different approach. Scientists have been studying lipid nanoparticles and their ability to deliver drugs to the brain for years now, but previous models could not measure how much mRNA actually made it to the central nervous system. \"I spent months figuring out the optimal conditions for this new in vitro system, including which cell growth conditions and fluorescent reporters to use,\" explains bioengineer Emily Han. \"Once robust, we screened our library of lipid nanoparticles and tested them on animal models.\" Fluorescence microscopy image showing red fluorescent protein mRNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles into brain endothelial cells (green with blue nuclei). ( Emily Han ) Of the 14 lipid nanoparticles the team tested in laboratory dishes, five were selected for further analysis in living mice. These drug 'packages' \u2013 labeled with fluorescent markers \u2013 showed high transport across the blood-brain barrier. When injected into the bloodstream of mice, some of the medicine generated a bioluminescent signal in brain cells that could be read by scientists as soon as six hours later. Still, while some lipid nanoparticles managed to get across the blood-brain barrier, not all the medicine actually made it into brain cells. This suggests that researchers need to be picky about which drug carriers they choose for future research. The authors hope their new in vitro model will help scientists identify the top candidates, guiding the future development of brain-targeted treatments. \"Furthermore,\" the team at UPenn adds , \"the platform could be re-engineered for studying lipid nanoparticle delivery to and across other biological barriers such as the blood-placental barrier, to study pregnancy-related diseases, and the blood-retinal barrier, to study retinal diseases.\" The study was published in Nano Letters .",

        "body": "'Obelisks': Entirely New Class of Life Has Been Found in The Human Digestive System Nature 29 January 2024 By Tessa Koumoundouros Scanning electron micrograph of human microbiome sample. (Science Photo Library/Canva) Peering into the jungle of microbes that live within us, researchers have stumbled across what seem to be an entire new class of virus-like objects. \"It's insane,\" says University of North Carolina cell biologist Mark Peifer, who was not involved in the study, told Elizabeth Pennisi at Science Magazine . \"The more we look, the more crazy things we see.\" These mysterious bits of genetic material have no detectable sequences or even structural similarities known to any other biological agents. So Stanford University biologist Ivan Zheludev and colleagues argue their strange discovery may not be viruses at all, but instead an entirely new group of entities that may help bridge the ancient gap between the simplest genetic molecules and more complex viruses. \"Obelisks comprise a class of diverse RNAs that have colonized, and gone unnoticed in, human, and global microbiomes,\" the researchers write in a preprint paper . Named after the highly-symmetrical, rod-like structures formed by its twisted lengths of RNA, the Obelisks' genetic sequences are only around 1,000 characters (nucleotides) in size. In fact, this brevity is likely one of the reasons we've failed to notice them previously. In a study that has yet to be peer reviewed, Zheludev and team searched 5.4 million datasets of published genetic sequences and identified almost 30,000 different Obelisks. They appeared in about 10 percent of the human microbiomes the team examined. In one set of data, Obelisks turned up in 50 percent of the patients' oral samples. What's more, different types of Obelisks appear to be present in different areas of our bodies. \"[This] supports the notion that Obelisks might include colonists of said human microbiomes,\" the researchers explain . They managed to isolate one type of host cell from our microbiome, the bacterium Streptococcus sanguini s \u2013 a common human mouth microbe. The Obelisk in these microbes had a loop 1,137 nucleotides long. \"While we don't know the 'hosts' of other Obelisks,\" write Zheludev and colleagues. \"it is reasonable to assume that at least a fraction may be present in bacteria.\" The question of the Obelisks' source aside, all seem to include codes for a new class of protein the researchers have named Oblins. Instructions for building these proteins seem to take up at least half of the Obelisks' genetic material. As these proteins are so similar across all the Obelisks, researchers suspect they may be involved in the entity's replication process. This ability to code for proteins makes them different from other known RNA loops called viroids, but they also don't seem to have the genes to make protein shells that RNA viruses (including COVID-19 ) live within when they're outside of cells. They're also significantly larger than other genetic molecules that coexist inside cells, from plants to bacteria, called plasmids , which are more commonly composed of DNA. However, Zheludev and team couldn't identify any impact of the Obelisks on their bacterial hosts, or a means by which they could spread between cells. \"These elements might not even be 'viral' in nature and might more closely resemble 'RNA plasmids,'\" they conclude . This research has been uploaded to the preprint serve, bioRxiv .",

(NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS) If signs of life really do exist on Mars, there's a chance the Perseverance rover has already rolled over them. Underground radar images suggest it is searching in the perfect spot for fossilized microbial life. As the robotic explorer, nicknamed Percy, wheels across a three-billion-year-old landscape, its instruments have confirmed that at least one Martian crater was filled with water long ago. Scientists strongly suspected the Jezero Crater once contained a delta system, as its surface holds the telltale signs of a dried-out lake bed, fed by an ancient river. That's why a Mars rover was sent to investigate the crater in February of 2021. Now that researchers can peer beneath Jezero's dusty exterior, they are more excited than ever by the possibility that Percy has already scooped up signs of extraterrestrial life. \"From orbit we can see a bunch of different deposits, but we can't tell for sure if what we're seeing is their original state, or if we're seeing the conclusion of a long geological story,\" explains planetary scientist and first author David Paige from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). \"To tell how these things formed, we need to see below the surface.\" Of all seven tools on board Perseverance, the ground-penetrating radar , called RIMFAX for short, is perhaps its greatest superpower. This system has the ability to detect ice, water, or salty brines more than 10 meters (30 feet) below the dusty surface, and it can map layers of soil and rock down to 20 meters. frameborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen> For a good chunk of last year, Perseverance was trundling along the western edge of the Jezero crater, and it was using its radar to probe the surface below. The data it collected have now provided an unprecedented glimpse below the Martian surface, in the very place where scientists suspect a lake to have been. Underground imaging now strongly suggests that hunch was right. Beneath the suspected delta, an international team of researchers found evidence that the 4-billion-year old crater, made by an asteroid impact , was later filled with younger sediment and rocks. The findings support previous RIMFAX data from a separate location, which revealed unexpected slopes in sediment layers deposited in the crater . These younger sediments could have been carried into the crater via water or volcanic activity, but the new radar data from Percy, suggests the former hypothesis is more likely. Diagram of the depositional and erosional history of the Jezero western delta region. (Paige et al., Science Advances , 2024) Beneath the western edge of Jezero, the horizontal layers of underground sediment seem to have been laid down in an aqueous environment that resembled an Earthly lake. This lake could have taken up a sizable chunk of the Jezero crater, possibly stretching inwards as far as 7 kilometers, although further exploration is needed to confirm this. Over time, its water levels varied, sometimes swelling, sometimes dissipating. As the lake retracted, it created a delta-like web of watery fingers. As the river swelled, it formed a lake again. If Mars is anything like Earth, such a long-lived aqueous environment would be an ideal place for microbial life to form. Already, Percy has drilled and captured several sediment samples from this very region. Its inventory is 60 percent full . Some of the rocks and dust Percy has collected even show intriguing signs of organic compounds . But until a mission is sent to collect the fruits of the rover's labor, it's impossible to say if these compounds come from biological or geological sources. \"This sequence of events\u2026 reinforces the notion that Jezero crater has recorded a rich geological history that was driven by large-scale changes in the martian environment,\" write the authors of the analysis. \"A more complete understanding of these events may need to await the return and analysis of the Perseverance samples.\" Let the impatient toe tapping begin.

(Philip Lucas/University of Hertfordshire) In the early days of telescopic astronomy, you could only focus on one small region of the sky at a time. Careful observations had to be done by hand, and so much of the breakthrough work centered around a particular object in the sky. A nebula or galaxy, quasar or pulsar . But over the years we've been able to build telescopes capable of capturing a wide patch of sky all at once, and with automation, we can now map the entire sky. Early sky surveys took years to complete, but many modern sky surveys can look for changes on the order of weeks or days. This ability to watch for changes across the sky is changing the way we do astronomy, and it is beginning to yield some interesting results. As a case in point, an infrared sky survey is revealing hidden stars we hadn't noticed before. In a series of papers published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , the authors have analyzed data from a decade-long survey called the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope (VISTA). VISTA allows astronomers to keep an eye on hundreds of millions of stars at infrared wavelengths. In these works, the team combed through the observations to focus on about 200 stars that showed the most dramatic shifts in brightness. These transient changes are important because they can reveal the subtle dynamics of stars. Artist's impression of an eruption in the disc of matter around a newborn star. (Philip Lucas/University of Hertfordshire) One goal of the studies was to look for very young stars. Stars in the earliest moments of transition toward becoming true fusion-powered stars. And within their selected stars they found 32 erupting protostars. All of them experienced a rapid increase of at least a factor of 40, and some brightened as much as a factor of 300. The outbursts lasted for months or years, and they seem to occur within the disk of matter surrounding the young stars. Based on the dynamics, these bursts can accelerate the growth of young stars, but they could also make it more difficult for planets to form. They refer to these turbulent protostars as squalling newborns. The team also found a surprise. Deep within the center of our galaxy, they found 21 red giant stars with dramatic brightness changes. They turned out to be a new type of red giant known as old smokers. The center of our galaxy is rich with heavy elements, so these red giants have a high metalicity. As they age, they can cast off clouds of dust that can obscure the star for a time. So the star temporarily fades from view and then re-brightens as the clouds disperse. This discovery could change our understanding of how heavy elements are released into the galaxy to be used by new stars. This article was originally published by Universe Today .

Around 3 hours after landing, JAXA made the tough decision to turn off the lander to conserve power , in the hopes that if the Sun hits SLIM's solar panels in future, it'll be ready to get up and restart operations. Still, in that short period of time, SLIM was still able to capture some useful information, and the agency has now zoomed in and started identifying and nicknaming rocks of interest.

Archaeologists discovered the mass grave holding over 107 skeletons in what is believed to have been a pagan-era cemetery near Kyiv, Ukraine. The mysterious burial site provided a glimpse into the Dark Ages, the 1,000 years of European history between the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.

The wooden buckets on the feet found in some of the male graves \u2013 which may have been part of funerary rituals \u2013 are reminiscent of 11th-century Prussian cremation and Pomeranian and Masovian inhumation cemeteries of military elites, the Independent reported.

He said the findings \"correspond well with the pan-European historical processes in Europe, and once again show the importance of studying the pan-European history as a whole and European peoples in the general context.\" He added that the nature of such a small and closed group was rare for its time. At the time of the cemetery's use, the people of the Ukraine region were undergoing a conversion to Christianity, most notably documented by the baptism of Volodymyr the Great, when he converted from his pagan beliefs to Christianity. The archaeological project in Ukraine began in 2017. Research continued in 2022 and 2023 despite the challenges the war posed. Baranov told BI that several regular members of the expedition had already died in battle and that others were on the frontlines after being mobilized.

(NASA/ESA/Leah Hustak, STScI/Ralf Crawford, STScI) The Hubble Space Telescope has observed the smallest planet outside our solar system to contain water vapor in its atmosphere, a \"landmark discovery\" that brings astronomy a step closer to characterizing Earth-like worlds. At around twice Earth's diameter, planet GJ 9827d orbits a red dwarf star 97 light-years away in the constellation Pisces, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) said in statements on Thursday. The team behind the finding are examining two scenarios: either the planet is a \"mini-Neptune\" with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere laced with water, or it's a warmer version of Jupiter 's moon Europa, which contains twice as much water as Earth under its crust. \"The planet GJ 9827d could be half water, half rock,\" said Bjorn Benneke of the Universite de Montreal, who co-led the research. \"And there would be a lot of water vapor on top of some smaller rocky body.\" \"Until now, we had not been able to directly detect the atmosphere of such a small planet. And we're slowly getting in this regime now,\" he added . Over a period of three years, Hubble observed the planet during 11 transients, or events in which it crossed in front of its star. During transients, starlight is filtered through the planet's atmosphere, allowing astronomers to use Hubble's instruments to analyze the patterns of colors (wavelengths), which revealed the telltale signature of water molecules. Even if GJ 9827d has a water-rich atmosphere, its hot, Venus-like temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (425 Celsius) would make it an uninhabitable steamy world. Nevertheless, the Hubble discovery paves the way to future study of GJ 9827d and similar planets, especially by the James Webb Space Telescope, which can use its high resolution infrared images to look for more atmospheric molecules including carbon dioxide, and methane. \"Water on a planet this small is a landmark discovery,\" added co-leader Laura Kreidberg of Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. \"It pushes closer than ever to characterizing truly Earth-like worlds.\" The research has been published in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters . \u00a9 Agence France-Presse",

Now, scientists may have found a way to stop this from happening. Part of the problem in reining in MYC is that it's a shapeless protein, one that doesn't really have a structure that can be targeted. That makes it difficult for drugs to effectively identify MYC and keep it behaving normally. However, a team from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) has been able to develop a peptide compound that can bind or interact with MYC and help get it back under control. The peptide (orange) binds to MYC (gray) to stop overactive DNA interactions. (Min Xue/UCR) \"MYC is less like food for cancer cells and more like a steroid that promotes cancer's rapid growth,\" says biochemist Min Xue, from UCR. \"That is why MYC is a culprit in 75 percent of all human cancer cases.\" \"Normally, MYC's activity is strictly controlled. In cancer cells, it becomes hyperactive, and is not regulated properly.\" The researchers were able to study the small amounts of structure that MYC does have in order to build up a library of peptides that might be able to snag on to that structure. One peptide in particular, NT-B2R, proved particularly adept at disabling MYC. In tests using a culture made from human brain cancer cells, NT-B2R was shown to successfully bind to MYC, changing the way cells regulated many of its genes and ultimately decreasing the metabolism and proliferation of the cancer cells . It's a bit like tying someone's hands behind their back, stopping them from doing anything much at all. Key to the breakthrough was earlier work by some of the same researchers, which recognized that as the structure and shape of peptides were changed, these molecules became better at interacting with shapeless proteins \u2013 like MYC. \"Peptides can assume a variety of forms, shapes, and positions. Once you bend and connect them to form rings, they cannot adopt other possible forms, so they then have a low level of randomness. This helps with the binding,\" says Xue. \"We improved the binding performance of this peptide over previous versions by two orders of magnitude. This makes it closer to our drug development goals.\" There's still a lot of work to be done, though these early results are promising. Right now the peptide is being delivered via fatty spheres called lipid nanoparticles , which aren't really suitable for dispensing drugs \u2013 so that will need to be changed. Rigorous tests in human subjects will also need to be carried out, but we just might have found a method for stopping one of the ways in which cancer hijacks healthy biological processes in order to survive . \"MYC represents chaos, basically, because it lacks structure,\" says Xue. \"That, and its direct impact on so many types of cancer make it one of the holy grails of cancer drug development. We are very excited that it is now within our grasp.\" The research has been published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .",

        "body": "World First Partial Heart Transplant Is Growing With a Baby Health 28 January 2024 By Felicity Nelson Owen Monroe, the first baby to receive a partial heart transplant. (Duke Health) The first baby to undergo a partial heart transplant will hopefully be spared repeated heart surgeries as the implanted tissue is growing with him \u2013 an outcome that has never been seen before in humans. Surgeons made history in 2022 when they stitched heart valves and vessels taken from a donor infant into the heart of transplant recipient Owen Monroe when he was just 18 days old. This technique of salvaging native heart tissue and only using the living donor tissue to replace defective parts had never been trialed in humans before. The lead surgeon, Joseph Turek of Duke University, had previously only done the procedure in five piglets. Now, more than a year on, baby Owen's heart has grown from the size of a strawberry to the size of an apricot, and the donor tissue has grown with it. Owen's heart tissue implants (solid line) are growing at a similar rate to heart tissue in healthy infants (dotted line). ( Turek et al., JAMA ) Owen's heart function is \"excellent,\" and he's hitting developmental milestones of a normal one-year-old, like playing, crawling, and standing, the researchers reported in JAMA . \"This publication is proof that this technology works, this idea works, and can be used to help other children,\" says Turek. Owen with his parents just after he was born. ( Duke Health ) Owen's parents \u2013 Nick and Tayler Monroe \u2013 consented to the surgery after learning that their baby had a serious heart defect known as truncus arteriosus , where a channel coming out of the heart fails to separate during development, merging two major blood vessels in a way that starves the baby of oxygen. This condition affects around 250 babies in the US each year. Usually, infants with truncus arteriosus are given a full heart transplant , or they are treated using frozen tissue from the hearts of cadavers. To ensure Owen's blood would pump around his heart correctly, he underwent a partial heart transplant where some of his heart tissue was removed and tissue from a donor heart was implanted. ( Turek et al., JAMA ) Donor hearts transplanted into infants will grow with the child, but they often become dysfunctional over time. As a result, around half of children given a heart transplant will die by the age of 20. To prevent transplanted hearts from being rejected by the immune system, recipients are put on drugs that suppress the immune system, which prevents the body from fighting not just the heart tissue but cancer and infections as well. Since Owen's procedure, 12 children have undergone partial heart transplants . ( Turek et al., JAMA ) It's the donor's heart muscle, rather than the valves and vessels, that the body tends to reject as foreign. As baby Owen was only given a partial transplant of vessels and valves, he only needed a half dose of one of these immunosuppressive drugs. Infants treated for truncus arteriosus with frozen cadaver tissue need surgery every few years to replace the grafts they've outgrown. As a result of these risky surgeries, this treatment carries a 50 percent mortality risk while they're still in infancy. frameborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen> Baby Owen was listed for a heart transplant, but his parents knew he was unlikely to survive the six months or so that it would take to match with a donor. A few days after birth, Owen was already in heart failure and his heart was too weak to be given emergency treatment, such as a heart-lung bypass called ECMO . \"Once we were told the situation and that we didn't have time to wait for a heart and he was basically at heart failure right out of the gate, there weren't really many options,\" Tayler Monroe said . \"If something happened, we would just resuscitate him and hope for the best, which is really hard and scary to hear.\" Fortunately, Owen's patched-up heart is now pumping normally and is \"expected to last a lifetime,\" the researchers report .

        "body": "Do You Live in a 'Blue Zone'? Here's Why You Might Live Longer For It Health 28 January 2024 By Justin Roberts et al., The Conversation Italian island of Sardinia is in the world's 'blue zone'. (Viktor_Gladkov/Getty Images) Ageing is an inevitable part of life, which may explain our strong fascination with the quest for longevity . The allure of eternal youth drives a multi-billion pound industry ranging from anti-ageing products, supplements and diets for those hoping to extend their lifespan. If you look back to the turn of the 20th century, average life expectancy in the UK was around 46 years. Today, it's closer to 82 years . We are in fact living longer than ever before , possibly due to medical advancements and improved living and working conditions . But living longer has also come at a price. We're now seeing higher rates of chronic and degenerative diseases \u2013 with heart disease consistently topping the list. So while we're fascinated by what may help us live longer, maybe we should be more interested in being healthier for longer. Improving our \" healthy life expectancy \" remains a global challenge. Interestingly, certain locations around the world have been discovered where there are a high proportion of centenarians who display remarkable physical and mental health. The AKEA study of Sardinia, Italy , as example, identified a \"blue zone\" (named because it was marked with blue pen), where there was a higher number of locals living in the central-eastern mountainous areas who had reached their 100th birthday compared with the wider Sardinian community. This longevity hotspot has since been expanded, and now includes several other areas around the world which also have greater numbers of longer-living, healthy people. Alongside Sardinia, these blue zones are now popularly recognised as: Ikaria, Greece; Okinawa, Japan; Nicoya, Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, California. Other than their long lifespans, people living in these zones also appear to share certain other commonalities, which centre around being part of a community , having a life purpose , eating nutritious, healthy foods , keeping stress levels low and undertaking purposeful daily exercise or physical tasks . Their longevity could also relate to their environment , being mostly rural (or less polluted), or because of specific longevity genes . However, studies indicate genetics may only account for around 20-25 percent of longevity \u2013 meaning a person's lifespan is a complex interaction between lifestyle and genetic factors, which contribute to a long and healthy life. Is the secret in our diet? When it comes to diet, each blue zone has its own approach \u2013 so one specific food or nutrient does not explain the remarkable longevity observed. But interestingly, a diet rich in plant foods (such as locally-grown vegetables, fruits and legumes) does appear to be reasonably consistent across these zones. For instance, the Seventh-day Adventists of Loma Linda are predominately vegetarian . For centenarians in Okinawa, high intakes of flavonoids (a chemical compound typically found in plants) from purple sweet potatoes, soy and vegetables, have been linked with better cardiovascular health \u2013 including lower cholesterol levels and lower incidences of stroke and heart disease. In Nicoya, consumption of locally produced rice and beans has been associated with longer telomere length . Telomeres are the structural part at the end of our chromosomes which protect our genetic material. Our telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides \u2013 so get progressively shorter as we age. Certain lifestyle factors (such as smoking and poor diet) can also shorten telomere length. It's thought that telomere length acts as a biomarker of ageing \u2013 so having longer telomeres could, in part, be linked with longevity. But a plant-based diet isn't the only secret. In Sardinia, for example, meat and fish is consumed in moderation in addition to locally grown vegetables and traditional foods such as acorn breads, pane carasau (a sourdough flatbread), honey and soft cheeses. Also observed in several blue zone areas is the inclusion of olive oil , wine (in moderation \u2013 around 1-2 glasses a day), as well as tea . All of these contain powerful antioxidants which may help protect our cells from damage as we age . Perhaps then, it's a combination of the protective effects of various nutrients in the diets of these centenarians, which explains their exceptional longevity. Another striking observation from these longevity hot spots is that meals are typically freshly prepared at home . Traditional blue zone diets also don't appear to contain ultra-processed foods , fast foods or sugary drinks which may accelerate ageing . So maybe it's just as important to consider what these longer-living populations are not doing, as much as what they are doing. There also appears to be a pattern of eating until 80 percent full (in other words partial caloric reduction ). This could be important in also ",

        "body": "There's a Surprisingly Simple Reason Why Some Kids Learn to Talk Earlier Humans 28 January 2024 By Carly Cassella (Jorn Georg Tomter/Getty Images) The first four years of human life are critical for language development, and yet the speed at which children learn to talk is highly variable. Most kids are saying single words by 18 months and progressing to phrases and sentences around two or three, but others are chatting away far earlier. For years now, psychologist Elika Bergelson from Harvard University has wondered what individual differences lead to this spectrum of abilities. Her recent observational study on the subject has now turned up surprising results. Enrolling 1,001 children under the age of four, she and an international team of psychologists were surprised to find no link between how much a kid vocalized during the day and their gender, socioeconomic status, or level of exposure to multiple languages. Instead, experimenters found that the chattiest children in the global study were those that tended to hear more adult talk in turn, along with age and clinical factors such as prematurity or dyslexia. \"Slower language development has often been attributed to parents from lower-socioeconomic backgrounds providing less input to their children (viewed from a middle-class Western-centric perspective), leading to calls for behavioral interventions aiming to increase it,\" write Bergelson and colleagues. \"Proponents of such interventions might highlight our correlation between adult talk and child speech; critics might instead underscore our finding that socioeconomic status was not significant in our main analyses nor in every other reanalysis we attempted.\" More studies are needed to figure out which interpretation is correct. The results of the study cannot reveal why child speech and adult talk are so intertwined, but there are a few possible explanations. Children who produce more speech may elicit more talk from adults, or it may be that more talkative environments promote more speech among children. The latter scenario would suggest that getting adults to talk more around their children may prove beneficial. Bergelson's research spans 12 countries and 43 languages, and incorporates both regional and urban areas. The audio for the study was collected via wearable recorders, which were placed on children of various stages of development and abilities aged two months to four years. Using machine learning to sift through more than 40,000 hours of recordings, Bergelson and her colleagues tested a variety of factors that might influence how often and how early a child babbles or says syllables, words, or sentences. Ultimately, the team found no compelling association between how many vocalizations a child made in the day and their gender or socioeconomic status (as determined by their mother's education level). Instead, the results reveal kids under four produce around 66 more vocalizations per hour with every year of development. That's to be expected, as age is closely tied to cognitive development, but there was another factor that also showed a surprisingly strong effect: kids who heard adults talking more, tended to talk more themselves. On average, for every 100 adult vocalizations heard by a child within an hour, that kid produced 27 more vocalizations. This 'adult talk' effect grew by 16 vocalizations with every year of child development. To put the significance of that effect in perspective, children in the study who showed non-normative language development, like dyslexia, produced 20 fewer vocalizations per hour compared to their peers. Every year, that gap widened by about 8 vocalizations an hour. The current study only counted sounds that were made during the day, which means it didn't examine the sophistication of language used by children. As a result, socioeconomic or gender factors may still impact some elements of language development that are overlooked in this study. Kids who are raised in higher socioeconomic households, for instance, could have parents that read more to them, possibly boosting their vocabulary or grammar development. Bergelson acknowledges that her recent study took a \"coarse-grained\" approach that may miss some finer details. \"It's the algorithm's estimate of how much speech the kid is hearing or producing,\" she told Christy DeSmith of the Harvard Gazette . \"But I think it's a complementary approach to what otherwise is very, very time-consuming and sample-limiting work.\" The study was published in PNAS .",

        "body": "Hell Chicken Discovery Could Tell Us Just How Doomed The Dinosaurs Were Nature 28 January 2024 By Kyle Atkins-Weltman & Eric Snively, The Conversation Birdlike dinosaur Eoneophron infernalis was about the size of an adult human. (Zubin Erik Dutta) Were dinosaurs already on their way out when an asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago, ending the Cretaceous , the geologic period that started about 145 million years ago? It's a question that has vexed paleontologists like us for more than 40 years. In the late 1970s, debate began about whether dinosaurs were at their peak or in decline before their big extinction. Scientists at that time noted that while dinosaur diversity seemed to have increased in the geologic stage that spanned 83.6 million to 71.2 million years ago, the number of species on the scene seemed to decrease during the last few million years of the Cretaceous. Some researchers have interpreted this pattern to mean that the asteroid that struck the Gulf of Mexico was simply the final blow for an already vulnerable group of animals . However, others have argued that what looks like a decrease in the diversity of dinosaurs may be an artifact of how hard it is to accurately count them . Fossil formations might preserve different dinosaurs more or less often based on factors like their favored environment and how easily their bodies fossilized there. The accessibility of various outcrops could influence what kinds of fossils researchers have so far found. These biases are a problem because fossils are what paleontologists must rely on to conclusively answer how healthy dinosaur populations were when the asteroid hit. At that crucial moment, what was really happening to dinosaur diversity? Discovery, identification and description of new dinosaurs provide vital clues. This is where our work comes in. Close examination of what we'd thought was a juvenile specimen of an already known species of dinosaur from this time period revealed that it was actually part of an adult from a completely new species. Our work focusing on the life stage of our specimen demonstrates that dinosaur diversity may not have been declining before the asteroid hit, but rather that there are more species from this time period yet to be discovered \u2013 potentially even through reclassification of fossils already in museum collections. Kyle Atkins-Weltman holds the femur of the new dinosaur as it was received, with the other fossils in the background. (Kyle Atkins-Weltman) Clues inside the bones of a birdlike dinosaur Our new study focused on four hindlimb bones \u2013 a femur , a tibia and two metatarsals . They were unearthed in South Dakota, in rocks of the Hell Creek Formation , and date to the final 2 million years of the Cretaceous. When we first examined the bones, we identified them as belonging to a family of dinosaurs known as the caenagnathids \u2013 a group of birdlike dinosaurs that had toothless beaks, long legs and short tails. Direct fossil and inferred evidence indicates these dinosaurs were covered in complex feathers , much like modern birds . The only known species of caenagnathid from this time and region was Anzu , sometimes called the \" chicken from Hell .\" Covered in feathers and sporting wings and a toothless beak, Anzu was between roughly 450 and 750 pounds (200 and 340 kilograms). Despite its fearsome nickname, though, its diet is a matter of debate. It was likely an omnivore, eating both plant material and small animals. Because our specimen was significantly smaller than Anzu , we simply assumed it was a juvenile. We chalked up the anatomical differences we noticed to its juvenile status and smaller size \u2013 and figured the animal would have changed had it continued to grow. Anzu specimens are rare, and no definite juveniles have been published in the scientific literature, so we were excited to potentially learn more about how it grew and changed throughout its lifetime by looking inside its bones . Just like with a tree's rings, bone records rings called lines of arrested growth . Each annual line represents part of a year when the animal's growth slowed. They would tell us how old this animal was, and how fast or slow it was growing. We cut through the middle of three of the bones so that we could microscopically examine the internal anatomy of the cross-sections. What we saw completely uprooted our initial assumptions . Teal markers point to lines of arrested growth on the cross-section of fossilized bone. Toward the outside of the bone, the lines are much closer together, reflecting less growth per year. Researchers counted exactly six lines, meaning this animal was between 6 and 7 years old when it died. (Holly Woodward) In a juvenile, we would expect lines of arrested growth in the bone to be widely spaced, indicating rapid growth, with even spacing between the lines from the inside to the outside surface of the bone. Here, we saw that the later lines were spaced progressively closer together, indicating tha",

        "body": "Diamonds Could Be Raining From The Sky on Far More Planets Than We Realized Space 28 January 2024 By David Nield Graphic showing how diamond rain might occur. (European XFEL/Tobias W\u00fcstefeld) If it were ever possible to take a flight through the extreme conditions of Neptune's atmosphere , we might experience the fascinating phenomenon of diamond rain tapping at our window. According to a new study by an international team of researchers, such a blizzard of bling could be relatively common throughout the Universe. Carbon can link into a crystal on giant, icy gas planets like Neptune and Uranus because of the ultra-high temperatures and pressures deep down in the atmosphere. These conditions break up hydrocarbons like methane, allowing the carbon atoms within to connect with four others and make particles of solid diamond . Based on the experiments outlined in the latest study, in which diamond-forming processes were simulated in lab conditions, the temperature and pressure thresholds for this kind of diamond formation are lower than scientists thought. How diamond rain could be happening on Neptune, and affecting its magnetic field. (European XFEL/Tobias W\u00fcstefeld) That would make diamond rain possible on smaller gas planets , so called 'mini-Neptunes'. There are plenty of these that we know about outside the Solar System. These findings might also explain some mysteries about Uranus's and Neptune's magnetic fields. \"This groundbreaking discovery not only deepens our knowledge of our local icy planets, but also holds implications for understanding similar processes in exoplanets beyond our Solar System,\" says physicist Siegfried Glenzer from the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The team behind the new study used the European XFEL (X-Ray Free-Electron Laser) to monitor diamonds being formed from hydrocarbon compound polystyrene film, pushed to huge pressures between a vice-like setup. Part of the experimental setup. (European XFEL/Jan Hosan) This configuration allowed the team to get a longer look at the process than had been possible in previous experiments . That drawn-out examination suggested that even though intense pressure and super-hot temperatures are still very much required, they might not have to be quite as extreme as previously thought. In terms of planets, this suggests diamonds could form at a shallower depth than scientists have been estimating \u2013 and that would then mean the descending diamond particles, dragging gas and ice along with them, might be influencing the magnetic fields of these planets in a more direct way than we've previously understood. Unlike Earth , ice planets like Neptune and Uranus don't have symmetrical magnetic fields. That's been something of a mystery up to this point \u2013 suggesting the magnetic fields aren't formed in the planetary core \u2013 and diamonds could help explain it. \"It might kick off movements within the conductive ices found on these planets, influencing the generation of their magnetic fields,\" says physicist Mungo Frost, from the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. This is all intriguing stuff that future studies can look into in more depth. In recent years, scientists have inched closer to understanding how this process might work on distant planets, and what the repercussions might be. Who knows \u2013 maybe one day we'll be able to do some actual field research in the demanding atmosphere of Neptune and Uranus, enabling us to see first-hand how this diamond rain is formed. \"Diamond rain on icy planets presents us with an intriguing puzzle to solve,\" says Frost. The research has been published in Nature Astronomy .",
        "summary": "Diamonds could be forming on far more planets than we thought. Carbon can link into a crystal on giant, icy gas planets like Neptune and Uranus. These conditions break up hydrocarbons like methane, allowing the carbon atoms within to connect with four others and make solid diamond.",

        "body": "HELSINKI \u2014 Japan\u2019s SLIM moon lander has resumed operations more than a week after its imperfect yet historic lunar landing.\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed contact had been reestablished with the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) spacecraft late Jan. 28. The development comes just days ahead of a likely mission-ending sunset.\nThe large SUV-sized spacecraft was forced to power down just two over hours after landing Jan. 19 due to its solar cell not generating electricity. SLIM finally powered up again as the position of the sun in the sky changed, finally illuminated SLIM\u2019s solar cell.\nThe spacecraft suffered a malfunction during descent that resulted in an unintended attitude upon landing and solar panels facing away from the sun.\nJAXA stated via X, formerly known as Twitter, that science observations were immediately started with SLIM\u2019s multiband spectroscopic camera (MBC), adding 10-band observations were made. The agency imaged a feature of a rock dubbed \u201ctoy poodle\u201d observed by the multi-band observation.\nCommunication with SLIM was successfully established last night, and operations resumed! Science observations were immediately started with the MBC, and we obtained first light for the 10-band observation. This figure shows the \u201ctoy poodle\u201d observed in the multi-band observation. pic.twitter.com/WYD4NlYDaG\nThe first hints that SLIM had been revived came from Germany-based amateur radio satellite organization AMSAT-DL. Its Bochum observatory detected a signal later confirmed to be SLIM engaged in a downlink with ground stations.\nThe sun will set over Shioli crater early Eastern Jan. 31, meaning SLIM has limited time to charge its batteries and conduct science observations.\nNeither SLIM nor its rovers carry radioisotope heater units. Thus they are not expected to survive the lunar nighttime, when temperatures will drop to around minus 130 Celsius.\n#SLIM @ISAS_JAXA_EN  is back?!  A Signal was visible for several minutes until 19:32:20 UTC when it turned off.  It's just after AOS, so we have 13 more hours to observe. Also visible sidebands on our second receiver at the moment when the beacon was switched off. pic.twitter.com/BL7DdmUxbZ\nMBC aboard SLIM will attempt to make observations that could generate useful lunar science data. Katherine Joy, a Reader in Earth Sciences at the University of Manchester, told SpaceNews ahead of the landing that the target site is located on an ejecta blanket of a much larger, roughly 100 km diameter, impact crater called Theophilus.\n\u201cIt might sample rocks and minerals that were excavated from deeper horizons within the lunar crust,\u201d Joy said.\nSLIM, nicknamed \u201cMoon Sniper\u201d for its main objective of demonstrating a precise lunar landing, touched down on the slope of the small, mid-latitude Shioli crater Jan. 19.\nWhile it landed within 55 meters of its target point\u2014well within the goal of 100-meter accuracy\u2014the spacecraft suffered a malfunction with one of its two main landing engines. This led to unexpected lateral momentum and a landing which saw the spacecraft come to rest on its nose.\nJAXA later published an image captured by descent cameras showing a thruster nozzle that had fallen free of the spacecraft. JAXA estimated that thrust was lost at around 50 meters above the lunar surface. There were no signs of any abnormality in the main engine until just before the incident occurred.\nSLIM was intended to descend thrusters down. A smaller thruster was then to be fired to orient the spacecraft onto its side just ahead of touchdown. The spacecraft was to be cushioned by five crushable, 3D-printed aluminum lattice landing legs.\nJAXA later confirmed the landing attitude meant SLIM\u2019s solar cell is facing westwards, resulting in it initially not receiving sunlight. The agency stated that it would attempt to reestablish contact later in the roughly 14.5-Earth-day-long lunar daytime, once the arrays should be receiving sunlight.\nSLIM also carried a pair of small, innovative rovers which it successfully deployed onto the moon in the final stages of descent. The 2.1-kilogram Lunar Excursion Vehicle 1 (LEV-1) uses a hopping mechanism, while LEV-2 is a 0.25-kg, baseball-sized, spherical rover.\nLEV-1 transmitted to Earth an image of SLIM taken by LEV-2, demonstrating inter-robot radio wave data transmission and revealing the landing state of the main spacecraft.",

The company will use the material to build radioisotope power sources, or RPS systems. These are compact devices that convert heat from isotopes into electricity.\u00a0 NASA for decades has used RPS systems for deep-space missions, but these systems are fueled by plutonium-238, an isotope that is in limited supply. Zeno designed an RPS system for small satellites fueled by strontium-90.\nThe company, based in Seattle and in Washington, D.C., has several contracts to develop radioisotope-powered satellites for national security and space exploration missions, as well as underwater systems for the U.S. Navy.\nChief executive Tyler Bernstein, who co-founded Zeno in 2018, said the company is on track to deliver its first RPS-powered satellite to the U.S. Air Force by 2026.\nDOE\u2019s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management, known as OREM, is working with Zeno to recycle large quantities of strontium-90 from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator built in the mid-1980s at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, but never deployed. Before DOE agreed to hand it over to Zeno, the generator was expected to remain in storage for another 30 years before OREM could dispose of it.\nZeno earlier this week announced it partnered with Westinghouse Electric Co. to process the radioisotopes for its\u00a0RPS heat sources.\nOREM manager Jay Mullis called the agreement with Zeno a \u201cwin-win\u201d as it helps remove a significant source of radioactivity at a DOE site while supporting nuclear-power innovation.\nOREM is responsible for removing radioactive materials resulting from decades of nuclear weapons development and government-sponsored nuclear energy research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Y-12 National Security Complex, and East Tennessee Technology Park.\nOREM\u2019s cleanup contractor United Cleanup Oak Ridge transported the radioisotope thermoelectric generator containing strontium-90 to a commercial nuclear facility at an undisclosed location in the Northeast, where Zeno will recycle the material to power its RPS.\nBernstein said Zeno designed its RPS to be fueled by strontium-90 because of its abundance. \u201cIt fills a demand that plutonium-238 cannot fill,\u201d he told SpaceNews.\u00a0 \u201cThe Department of Energy can only produce enough plutonium-238 to fulfill marquee NASA missions.\u201d\nZeno needed a fuel source to \u201cbuild this technology at scale to meet the demand that we see in the coming decades,\u201d Bernstein said.\u00a0The company to date has won more than $40 million in contracts to build RPS powered satellites, and expects more orders, said Bernstein.\n\u201cThe momentum for space nuclear power is only growing and you\u2019re seeing this with broader support at the upper levels of the Pentagon, and you are seeing more commercial industry in this area developing these technologies,\u201d he said.\nThe military wants spacecraft with increased mobility and endurance, he added.

        "body": "BALTIMORE \u2013 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency\u2019s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) constellation could provide valuable data on methane emissions.\nWith imagery from the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), researchers identified a large natural gas pipeline release and quantified total emissions. By comparing imagery captured every five minutes, the researchers showed how emissions changed over time and determined the duration of the leak.\nThe research has not yet been peer reviewed, but \u201cthe potential for this technique is enormous,\u201d Shobha Kondragunta, Aerosols and Atmospheric Composition science team lead at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Satellite and Information Service, said Jan. 21 in a SpaceNews webinar on methane monitoring.\nThe goal of mitigating methane emissions has risen to the top of the climate agenda. Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in its atmospheric warming potential. Plus, with the right tools, methane leaks can be rapidly identified and halted.\nMost government satellites that spot methane emissions travel in low-Earth orbit, providing few opportunities to revisit targets multiple times per day. In contrast, the Advanced Baseline Imagers on NOAA\u2019s GOES-East and GOES-West satellites work together to observe the Americas and surrounding oceans every 10 minutes. Views of the continental U.S. and parts of Canada and Mexico are available every five minutes.\nHarvard University, ETH Zurich, the Polytechnic University of Valencia and the United Nation\u2019s International Methane Emissions Observatory conducted the research on ABI\u2019s utility for methane leaks. Researchers focused on emissions in 2019 from a natural gas pipeline in Durango, Mexico. The leak was detected at the time by Tropomi, an instrument on the\u00a0European  Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite.\nWith shortwave infrared data from ABI, researchers determined that the release lasted three hours. During the release, 260 to 550 metric tons of methane were released per hour. The total amount of methane emitted, 1,130 to 1,380 metric tons, is \u201cenough to power 3,600\u20134,400 Mexican urban households for a year,\u201d according to the paper, \u201cGeostationary satellite observations of extreme methane emissions from a natural gas pipeline.\u201d The paper was posted in June on the online preprint server EarthArXiv.\n\u201cWe show how the time-dependent source rate can be estimated from a sequence of 5-minute GOES scans without the need for information on local wind speed,\u201d the authors said. \u201cOur results demonstrate the unique value of geostationary satellite instruments for detecting extreme and brief methane emission events, quantifying emissions from variable point sources, and precisely determining source locations.\u201d\nThe potential for geostationary satellite imagers to spot significant methane emissions \u201cis a new development,\u201d said Kondragunta. Working with the researchers, \u201cwe will try to bring some of those capabilities to NOAA,\u201d she added.\nABI, the GOES primary instrument, gathers data at resolutions between 0.5 and 2 kilometers per pixel in 16 spectral bands.\nWhile ABI\u2019s potential application for methane monitoring is a new, \u201cit\u2019s not the first time that ABI capabilities have proven to be useful in a new observational area that has a high impact,\u201d Shikha Ganguly, L3Harris general manager for weather and space systems, told SpaceNews at the American Meteorological Society\u2019s annual meeting here. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that there\u2019s another area being explored to tap into some more utility there.\u201d\nABI\u2019s successor, the GeoXO imager, will have even greater observational capabilities. Seven of ABI\u2019s 16 channels will have improved resolution. L3Harris is developing the new imager under a $765.5 million contract awarded in March 2023.\n\u201cWe will continue to enhance our ability to bring these observations to tracking phenomena like this,\u201d Ganguly said.",
        "summary": "Researchers identified a large natural gas pipeline release and quantified total emissions. Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in its atmospheric warming potential. With the right tools, methane leaks can be rapidly identified and halted.",

        "body": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Eutelsat expects to take a 7% revenue hit as delays securing landing rights in India, Thailand, Turkey, and elsewhere prevent the OneWeb broadband constellation it finished launching nearly a year ago from providing global coverage before the second half of 2024.\nThe company had planned to start providing the service worldwide in early 2024 after deploying 633 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), including in-orbit spares.\nHowever, Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke said in a Jan. 29 management call with analysts that the company is behind on rolling out gateways for the constellation, and expects to have only completed 90% of the ground network by the end of June.\nOnly 30 gateways have been installed so far, Eutelsat spokesperson Joanna Darlington told SpaceNews via email, and the aim is to reach 38 by the second half of 2024, and then deploy the rest over the following six months.\nAround 40 gateways are needed for global service, Berneke said on the management call, and gaps include countries such as India and Saudi Arabia where Eutelsat has significant \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d contracts for LEO broadband capacity. The take-or-pay contracts require the buyer to accept delivery of LEO capacity once operational or pay a penalty.\nLEO delays mean Eutelsat now expects to record revenues for its fiscal year to the end of June between 1.25 billion and 1.3 billion euros ($1.35-1.4 billion) \u2014 versus 1.32 billion to 1.42 billion euros previously \u2014 mainly driven by the entry into service of two geostationary satellites: Eutelsat 10B and Konnect VHTS.\nAdjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is now due to come in at between 650 million and 680 million euros for the current fiscal year, 14% lower than previously expected.\nLast year, Eutelsat had expected OneWeb to contribute between 125 million and 225 million euros in revenues over the 12 months to June 30, 2024. Most of Eutelsat\u2019s current LEO broadband services are in North America while it waits to expand the network globally.\nPreviously a geostationary-only satellite operator, France-based Eutelsat acquired the LEO network after buying OneWeb of the United Kingdom in September to diversify its broadband business.\nLEO contracts are secure\nBerneke said Eutelsat has around 1.15 billion euros worth of LEO business in the pipeline, including a 275 million euro take-or-pay contract from within the group.\nThese agreements are typically five-year contracts, she said, and are not subject to cut-offs that would be affected by the ground segment delays.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t see this at all as melting ice cubes,\u201d she said in response to an analyst\u2019s question.\n\u201cAlmost the contrary, I think there\u2019s quite a lot of customers right now asking for additional take-or-pay\u201d contracts, she said, adding \u201cwe\u2019re in a couple of discussions with customers who\u2019ve taken a first chunk, and now are discussing to increase that.\u201d\nShe said the LEO business backlog increased by around 150 million euros over the previous few months following a couple more take-or-pay contracts.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Cygnus cargo spacecraft is set to launch on a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time, a combination that required more changes to the rocket than to the spacecraft.\nNASA announced at a Jan. 26 briefing that it was targeting Jan. 30 at 12:07 p.m. Eastern for the launch of the NG-20 cargo mission from Cape Canaveral\u2019s Space Launch Complex 40. That is a one-day slip from previous plans, which the agency said was to \u201caccommodate launch pad readiness.\u201d If Cygnus launches that day, it will arrive at the International Space Station early Feb. 1.\nThe launch marks the first time Northrop Grumman\u2019s Cygnus cargo spacecraft has flown on Falcon 9. All previous launches of Cygnus have been on Northrop\u2019s own Antares launch vehicle with the exception of two missions that launched on United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas 5 after an Antares launch failure in 2014.\nNorthrop plans to launch at least three Cygnus missions on Falcon 9 rockets as it works with Firefly Aerospace on a new version of the Antares, replacing the Ukrainian-built first stage powered by Russian engines with a stage developed by Firefly using its own engines. That vehicle, the Antares 330, is slated to begin launches as soon as mid-2025.\nThe shift to the Falcon 9 has been relatively smooth for Northrop. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have to make any modifications to the Cygnus,\u201d said Cyrus Dhalla, vice president and general manager of tactical space systems at Northrop Grumman, during the briefing. The company did make minor changes to the cargo loading process, which he attributed to doing it in a new facility with different equipment.\nThe shift in launch vehicles doesn\u2019t alter the capabilities of the Cygnus, he added. The NG-20 mission will carry a little more than 3,700 kilograms of cargo, the capacity of the current version of the vehicle.\nSpaceX, though, did have to make changes to accommodate Cygnus, specifically its ability for \u201clate load\u201d of cargo within 24 hours of launch. The Antares has a \u201cpop top\u201d opening at the top of the rocket\u2019s payload fairing, allowing access to the Cygnus inside for cargo loading after the spacecraft has been encapsulated.\nTo provide a similar late load capability for Falcon 9 launches of Cygnus, SpaceX created what Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, called a \u201cgigadoor\u201d in the fairing of the Falcon 9. That is a door 1.5 by 1.2 meters in the side of the fairing that can be opened to provide environmentally controlled access to the Cygnus inside.\n\u201cThis will be the first time we\u2019ve done that,\u201d he said, as SpaceX\u2019s own Dragon spacecraft launches without a fairing. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of modifications on our part to get this hardware ready to go fly.\u201d He added that putting the door in the payload fairing does not affect SpaceX\u2019s ability to recover and reuse it.\n\u201cWe really appreciate how SpaceX has worked with us to accommodate the flow of cargo and integration, and we\u2019ve been able to reuse a lot of our procedures,\u201d Dhalla said.\nBesides the development of the payload fairing door for Cygnus launches, SpaceX has been testing modifications to its transporter erector at Launch Complex 39A, enabling it to load liquid methane and oxygen propellants. That is required for the upcoming launch of the IM-1 lunar lander by Intuitive Machines, which will be fueled on the pad, inside the payload fairing, shortly before launch.\nGerstenmaier said SpaceX was doing testing of that equipment to ensure it is ready for the IM-1 launch, currently projected for mid-February. \u201cThat work is pretty much on track,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of interesting integration but, as you see even with this Northrop Grumman 20 mission, we at SpaceX like to do innovative and creative things.\u201d",

Unity separated about 45 minutes later, igniting its hybrid rocket engine. The vehicle reached a peak altitude of 88.8 kilometers before gliding back to a runway landing at the spaceport at 12:56 p.m. Eastern, according to data provided by the company\nThe flight, called Galactic 06 by Virgin Galactic, carried four customers for the first time, along with its two pilots. Previous commercial flights had three customers on board along with a Virgin Galactic astronaut trainer.\nAs with some recent flights, Virgin Galactic disclosed the identities of the four private astronauts only after the end of the mission. They are Americans Neil Kornswiet and Robie Vaughn, Ukrainian-American Lina Borozdina and Austrian Franz Haider. Unity was commanded by C.J. Sturckow with Nicola Pecile as pilot.\nVirgin Galactic also did not provide a webcast of the launch, as on some previous flights, instead providing updates on social media. Those updates significantly lagged behind the timing of flight activities: the post on X (formerly Twitter) announcing the landing of Unity at the conclusion was published more than 35 minutes after landing.\n\u201cThe success of Galactic 06 and the company\u2019s other commercial spaceflights in recent months only increases our confidence in the repeatability of our product and our ability to deliver a superlative experience to our customers,\u201d Michael Colglazier, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said in a statement.\nThe flight was the first since a dedicated research flight, Galactic 05, Nov. 2. That flight was the sixth in less than six months for the vehicle, but Virgin Galactic said it would pause flights until January for an annual maintenance period.\nJust a week after Galactic 05, though, Virgin Galactic announced it would soon wind down flights of VSS Unity, citing the need to conserve its cash reserves for development of its next-generation Delta class of suborbital vehicles. Those future vehicles are intended to fly more frequently and at lower costs than Unity.\nVirgin Galactic said then that, after Galactic 06, it would fly Unity again on Galactic 07 in the second quarter of the year and, perhaps, a Galactic 08 mission in mid-2024. The company then plans to retire VSS Unity and shift resources into Delta-class vehicle development.\n\u201cWith the production of our next-generation Delta-class ships underway, we look forward to expanding our flight capacity with testing expected to start next year and commercial service in 2026,\u201d Colglazier said in the statement.\nThe company confirmed in the statement that Galactic 07 will take place in the second quarter and fly a researcher along with private astronauts. It did not provide other details about the flight.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission has clarified, but not altered, rules to mitigate orbital debris.\nThe five FCC commissioners voted unanimously during a Jan. 25 meeting to approve an order on reconsideration of rules it adopted in 2020. The order was a response to three petitions from industry seeking changes to the rules and how they are applied to satellite operators.\nThe order \u201cwill uphold the current regulatory environment for orbital debris mitigation while providing additional clarity and guidance for satellite operators, and reinforces the commission\u2019s commitment to space safety,\u201d said Julie Kearney, chief of the FCC\u2019s Space Bureau, at the meeting.\nOne petition, by Boeing, EchoStar, Hughes Network Services, Planet, Spire and Telesat, asked the FCC to reconsider disclosure requirements on maneuverability and other technical aspects of licensed spacecraft that could \u201cexcessively encumber\u201d the industry. The petition also questioned requirements that \u201cdiverge substantially\u201d from other U.S. government guidance, like the Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP).\nThe FCC concluded that there was nothing in its rules that was \u201cfundamentally inconsistent\u201d from other guidance, and that it had the ability to tailor the guidance of the ODMSP, which is intended only to apply to U.S. government missions. It also dismissed \u201cspeculative concerns\u201d about overly burdensome disclosure rules, but did provide guidance on several technical topics.\nA second petition, filed by SpaceX, sought to have the FCC\u2019s rules applied to both U.S. companies licensed by the FCC as well as foreign companies that instead seek market access from the commission. The FCC, in the latter case, allows companies to instead demonstrate they are subject to \u201cdirect and effective regulatory oversight\u201d by the country that authorizes them.\nThe FCC concluded that foreign companies seeking market access must provide supporting documentation to demonstrate they do follow orbital debris mitigation rules, an approach the commission said in its order \u201cprovides more flexibility and can serve the public interest better by being less burdensome.\u201d\nThe third petition, from Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, asked the FCC to include rules that establish orbital separation requirements between large constellations. The FCC rejected that request, concluding that coordination among satellite operators remains the \u201cbest solution for maintaining space safety\u201d even as satellite constellations proliferate.\n\u201cIn this decision, we reaffirm the updates that we made earlier to our orbital debris mitigation rules and offer additional guidance to satellite operators,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. \u201cWe\u2019re reinforcing our commitment to space sustainability.\u201d\nWhile the order passed unanimously, one commissioner, Nathan Simington, sided with SpaceX\u2019s opposition to how the rules are applied to non-U.S. systems. \u201cIn practice, it often places U.S.-licensed providers, and ultimately the United States as a policy leader, at somewhat of a disadvantage,\u201d he said, arguing that orbital debris rules in other countries are not as robust as those in the United States.\nThe orbital debris rules are one part of a \u201cspace innovation\u201d agenda at the FCC. Rosenworcel said that the day before the meeting, she shared with fellow commissioners a proposal for licensing spacecraft for in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing applications, something the FCC has been studying for several years.\nThe same day that the FCC approved the orbital debris order, a group of senators introduced legislation to authorize space traffic coordination activities underway by the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Space Commerce.\nThe Situational Awareness of Flying Elements in Orbit Act, or SAFE Orbit Act, would formally authorize the office to develop and operate a space traffic coordination system, including maintaining a public catalog and providing basic services at no charge. The Office is already developing such a system, called the Traffic Coordination System for Space or TraCSS.\n\u201cThe SAFE Orbit Act would require the Office of Space Commerce to collect and share relevant data to strengthen our space situational awareness and space traffic coordination efforts,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), lead sponsor of the bill, in a statement.\nCo-sponsors of the SAFE Orbit Act include Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.)

However, the plans ground to a halt two years later after what the company said was a misinformation campaign over the potential for GPS interference.\nIn addition to the United States, Ligado is suing the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Commerce (DoC), and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).\nAttorneys for the government filed a motion Jan. 25 to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the court lacks jurisdiction because the Communications Act requires an exclusive administrative and judicial review framework for such claims arising out of FCC licensing decisions.\nEven if the U.S. Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction, the attorneys said Ligado could not claim these property rights for an intangible license.\n\u201cIndeed, no court has held that an FCC license is property for takings purposes,\u201d they wrote in a Jan. 25 motion to dismiss the lawsuit, \u201cand the Court with primary jurisdiction over FCC licensing matters \u2014 the D.C. Circuit \u2014 has held that FCC licenses are not property under the Takings Clause.\u201d\nA so-called takings claim \u2014 for when the government seizes private property for public use \u2014 also requires the government action at issue to be authorized and lawful, the motion continues, whereas Ligado alleges its FCC license was blocked unlawfully.\nSpectrum accusation\nIn the Oct. 12 lawsuit, Ligado claimed the DoD had been using the L-band frequencies without providing compensation.\nThe lawsuit cited testimony from senior government officials that referred to the DoD\u2019s use of Ligado\u2019s spectrum, including a letter sent in 2022 to the heads of the DoD, DoC, and NTIA.\nIn the letter, U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) said they had learned of DoD concerns about Ligado\u2019s 5G plans that stem from their potential to interfere with federal systems. The use of the spectrum for these federal systems was not disclosed to the FCC before the spectrum regulator approved Ligado\u2019s proposed terrestrial network in 2020.\nLigado said details about DoD\u2019s use of its spectrum have not been publicly disclosed, but that multiple senior government officials have told the company the DoD needs all of its spectrum authorized for wireless terrestrial 5G services.\n\u201cThese officials also told Ligado that DoD needs this spectrum both exclusively and permanently,\u201d the company said in the October lawsuit.\nThe Jan. 26 motion for dismissal said Ligado had not pleaded \u201cany plausible facts to support its purely speculative claim that the Government has occupied its licensed spectrum.\u201d\nThe motion also said Ligado had not identified any authorized government action that prevented it from using its modified license.\nLigado put its terrestrial wireless plans on hold after a review released in September 2022 by the congressionally-mandated National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine warned they would likely interfere with some GPS signals and Iridium\u2019s space-based communications services.\nThe latest twist in a long-running saga\nLigado said Jan. 26 it continues to stand firmly by its original complaint and is working on a reply to the government\u2019s motion.\n\u201cAs set out in the company\u2019s lawsuit, government officials deliberately deprived Ligado of its rightfully licensed property, and the government must be held accountable,\u201d a company spokesperson said via email.\n\u201cThis attack on an American business by the world\u2019s most powerful institution is contrary to the rule of law and antithetical to the government\u2019s years-long support for the deployment of 5G technology as a vital national priority.\u201d\nIridium, which also operates in L-band, and other Ligado critics have repeatedly called on the FCC to reverse its 2020 approval, which included restrictions to guard against interference.\nThe DoD, DoC, and NTIA had once supported the development of the company\u2019s plans to use satellite spectrum for a terrestrial network, Ligado noted in an Oct. 13 news release.\nHowever, Ligado said the DoD reversed course in 2018 and sought to instead block the network through a misinformation campaign that used a threat to GPS devices as the pretext, with the DoC and NTIA following soon after.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Medical researchers and commercial spaceflight advocates are working to begin a new effort to study the health issues and risks that space travel poses to a more diverse population of private astronauts.\nVirgin Galactic is scheduled to perform the latest flight of its VSS Unity suborbital spaceplane Jan. 26 from Spaceport America in New Mexico. The Galactic 06 mission will carry four customers along with two pilots, a change from earlier flights that flew three customers and one astronaut trainer. The company has not disclosed the identities of those customers.\nThe Virgin Galactic flights, along with other suborbital flights by Blue Origin and several orbital missions by SpaceX, have allowed dozens of private astronauts to go to space in the last few years. Many of those people would likely have not passed strict medical standards used by NASA and other space agencies for professional astronauts.\nExamples include Jon Goodwin, an 80-year-old man who flew on a Virgin Galactic mission last year despite having Parkinson\u2019s disease. Hayley Arceneaux, a member of the Inspiration4 Crew Dragon mission in 2021, is a cancer survivor with a prosthetic leg bone. Actor William Shatner went on a Blue Origin suborbital flight in 2021 at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to go to space.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more and more,\u201d said Jim Bridenstine, former NASA administrator, of such private astronauts in remarks at a two-day workshop this week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that he helped organize. \u201cWhen we think about these activities, we\u2019ve got to absolutely keep people safe.\u201d\nThe concern he and others at the meeting discussed is a lack of information about health risks to populations much broader than professional astronauts. Commercial spaceflight in the United States operates on an \u201cinformed consent\u201d regime where prospective private astronauts are informed of the various risks and then consent to accept them.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do informed consent, we have to be able to do the \u2018informed\u2019 piece,\u201d Bridenstine said.\nThe workshop discussed a proposal outlined in a recent report to establish a Human Research Program for Civilians in Spaceflight and Space Habitation, or HRP-C. The effort, modeled on NASA\u2019s own Human Research Program, would collect medical data from spaceflight participants and conduct focused research on potential spaceflight risks.\nThe purpose of HRP-C is research, not regulatory. \u201cOur mission is to have as many people fly in space as possible based on strong science,\u201d said Michael Schmidt, chief executive of Solvaris Aerospace. \u201cIt was never about how to screen people who should and shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d\nThere have been some efforts to collect medical data on private astronauts but done on an ad hoc basis. One such effort is by the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), called Enhancing Exploration Platforms and Analog Definition, or EXPAND, that started with the Inspiration4 mission.\nThat effort operates on a \u201cshoestring\u201d budget, said Jennifer Fogarty of TRISH at the workshop. The center is working to fill gaps in the population of space travelers, including a new initiative this year focused on women. \u201cFor a lot of women, it is a real challenge to describe to them what in particular are the risks to them in the future,\u201d she said.\nThe HRP-C effort is examining several ways to organize itself. George Nield, a former Federal Aviation Administration associate administrator for commercial space transportation who also went on a Blue Origin suborbital flight, recommended at the workshop establishing a nonprofit organization for HRP-C that could be backed by a combination of private and government funding. \u201cIt would be focused on research and data sharing, and not regulations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEven though individuals or civilians who wish to go into space are willing to take the risk, it becomes a concern from a health perspective,\u201d said Michael Marge of SUNY Upstate Medical University, one of the editors of the HRP-C report, at the conclusion of the workshop. \u201cWe will continue with the HRP-C to reduce the risks to the greatest degree possible.\u201d",

        "body": "Updated Jan. 26 to clarify no link between Artemis 2/3 delays and any Gateway launch delay.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Northrop Grumman has taken another charge on its contract to build a module for NASA\u2019s lunar Gateway, bringing its losses for the year on that program to $100 million.\nIn its fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release Jan. 25, the company disclosed a $42 million \u201cunfavorable EAC [estimate at completion] adjustment\u201d on its contract to build the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module for the Gateway. The company recorded a similar $36 million charge in the second quarter and said the overall charge for the year on the contract reached $100 million.\nThe company blamed the latest charge primarily on \u201ccost growth stemming from evolving Lunar Gateway architecture and mission requirements combined with macroeconomic challenges.\u201d The company offered the same explanation when it reported the charge in the second quarter.\nNorthrop received a $935 million fixed-price contract from NASA in July 2021 to build the module, which is based on the company\u2019s Cygnus cargo spacecraft. HALO will provide initial living accommodations on the Gateway and includes several docking ports for visiting Orion spacecraft and lunar landers as well as additional modules provided by international partners. It will launch together with the Maxar-built Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) on a Falcon Heavy.\nIn July, when Northrop reported the second-quarter charge, company executives said they thought they had mitigated the risk of design changes by doing initial work on HALO under cost-plus contracts before accepting a fixed-price contract to produce it.\n\u201cAs it\u2019s turning out on the HALO program, the requirements are not as stable as we or the government anticipated, and we\u2019re working with them to address that change management as we go forward,\u201d Kathy Warden, chief executive of Northrop Grumman, said in the July earnings call.\nWarden mentioned the latest charge only in passing in the company\u2019s latest earning call, which was dominated by discussion of a far larger charge the company took on its contract for production of the B-21 stealth bomber. \u201cWe have programs like HALO which we have certainly learned some additional lessons and are applying those as we move forward,\u201d she said.\nNorthrop, she said, was taking a more cautious approach bidding on fixed-price contracts in general. \u201cWe have taken a different approach in looking at firm fixed price, where we\u2019ve either declined to bid if the customer chose to go fixed price, or we\u2019ve offered a price, in the case of SDA Tranche 2, that we thought was fair and reasonable and the customer decided not to further negotiate with us.\u201d\nThe Space Development Agency awarded contracts to L3Harris, Lockheed Martin and Sierra Space Jan. 16 for the Tracking Layer Tranche 2 constellation of missile-tracking satellites with a combined value of about $2.5 billion. Northrop had won a contract in 2022 to provide some of the satellites for Tracking Layer Tranche 1.\nNASA had been working towards an October 2025 launch of HALO and PPE, but during the agency\u2019s announcement Jan. 9 that it was delaying the next two Artemis missions by nearly a year the agency said that first Gateway launch could separately be delayed .\n\u201cWe\u2019re now working with our industry partners at Maxar and Northrop Grumman to review the schedule of when it makes sense to launch that before Artemis 4,\u201d which remains scheduled for no earlier than September 2028, said Amit Kshatriya, NASA deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, in a call with reporters to announce the delay. \u201cWe believe they have a great path to get it there to support that mission, but we will be updating that schedule.\u201d",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Satellites set to launch in 2024 will dramatically increase the international community\u2019s ability to detect atmospheric methane. Still, far more data will be needed to reach international goals to curb emissions.\n\u201cWe need to understand where these emissions are around the globe,\u201d said Steven Hamburg, Environmental Defense Fund chief scientist.\nPlus, it\u2019s necessary to quantify methane emissions and monitor changes over time, panelists said during a Jan. 21 SpaceNews webinar on methane monitoring.\nGovernment sensors like Tropomi, an instrument on the European Space Agency-European Commission Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, and Japan\u2019s Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellites provide extensive data. Commercial airborne and space-based sensors also help.\nCanada\u2019s GHGSat, for example, monitors industrial greenhouse gas facilities with a constellation of 12 satellites. GHGSat shares data with NASA, ESA, the United Nations and the oil and gas industry.\nIn contrast to the current piecemeal approach, what\u2019s needed is something more like the national weather systems around the globe, said Riley Duren, University of Arizona research scientist and CEO of Carbon Mapper, a nonprofit focused on measuring greenhouse gas emissions.\nNationals weather systems combine data from ground, airborne and space-based sensors to provide \u201ccontinuous operational insight of what\u2019s happening with weather,\u201d Duren said.\nGreenhouse gas monitoring has not received the same resources.\n\u201cWe have benefited from over a decade of dramatic advances in research and technology that have demonstrated that these remote-sensing technologies provide actual data, but they\u2019re not yet deployed at scale,\u201d Duren said.\nAs a result, no one has a clear picture of global methane emissions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a pair of glasses, but they\u2019re pretty fuzzy,\u201d said Hamburg, CEO of MethaneSAT LLC. MethaneSAT is an Environmental Defense Fund affiliate that locates, measures and tracks methane emissions with airborne sensors and a satellite set to launch in 2024.\nIn the next year or two, data from new and existing satellites will \u201callow us to put on a much higher-quality set of glasses,\u201d Hamburg said.\nStill, the challenge is multifaceted. It\u2019s important to map global emissions to reveal the total quantity of atmospheric methane, its distribution and to track changes over time. In addition, granular data is needed to reveal methane emissions coming from individual facilities or places \u201cso that we can fix or reduce those emissions,\u201d Hamburg said.\nData from new methane-monitoring satellites will help.\nMethaneSAT\u2019s space-based instrument will reveal regional-scale emissions and identify large methane sources.\nAlso on deck is the Tanager-1 satellite with a hyperspectral sensor to pinpoint, quantify and track point sources of methane and carbon dioxide. And NASA may extend the operation of the Earth Ventures-Instrument (EVI-4) Mission\u00a0imaging spectrometer on the International Space Station, which has proven to be surprisingly adept at greenhouse gas monitoring.\nJapan is scheduled to launch an infrared spectrometer to measure monthly mean concentrations of greenhouse gases, calculate national anthropogenic greenhouse gas inventories and survey large emission sources like power plants.\nResearchers are finding innovative ways to use existing satellite sensors as well.\n\u201cHarvard University developed a simple algorithm to derive methane from our geostationary satellite imagers,\u201d said Shobha Kondragunta, aerosols and atmospheric composition science team lead at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Satellite and Information Service. \u201cWe can take advantage of these imagers\u2019 shortwave infrared observations to look at the methane leaks from facilities. One huge advantage of this technique, if the promise is realized, is we get direct emissions or fluxes from our imagers because our geostationary satellites take snapshots every five minutes or 10 minutes.\u201d\nAll these tools are helpful.\n\u201cIn tackling methane and greenhouse gas mitigation and monitoring in general, there\u2019s a need for a large toolbox because the emissions that we\u2019re trying to help people reduce and understand and track and quantify occur across a wide range of scales,\u201d Duren said. \u201cAnd there is a need for multiple tools in that toolbox.\u201d\nIn spite of recent progress, it will take a coalition of government agencies working with nongovernmental organizations and companies \u201cto tackle the grand challenge here: comprehensive, sustained, operational monitoring to drive methane and CO2 emission reductions globally,\u201d Duren said.",

However, neither he nor other European Commission officials at the conference elaborated on specific provisions likely to be in the bill.\nIn a panel discussion at the conference, Ekaterini Kavvada, director for secure and connected space in the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space, said the commission expected to release legislative proposal for the space law in March. She emphasized the same themes for the legislation as Breton but did not go into specifics.\n\u201cEverybody talks about it, everybody has very high expectations, but nobody has ever seen it,\u201d quipped Thomas Dermine, state secretary for science policy in the Belgian government, of the proposed space law on that panel. Belgium holds the EU presidency for the first half of 2024 and has made a space law a priority.\nMembers of the European Parliament, which will take up the legislative proposal once it is released, supported the broad themes that commission officials have outlined for the law. \u201cAll of this has been floating around the European Parliament for much longer,\u201d said Niklas Nienass, a member of the parliament. That includes, he said, \u201cclear support for the single market, the ability for companies throughout Europe to easily work together on space matters.\u201d\nHe and Christophe Grudler, another member of the parliament, saw the bill as a way for Europe to take leadership on global space regulations. \u201cWe will demanding clear rules in particular for sustainability,\u201d Grudler said. \u201cWe can begin with our EU space law, and afterwards it can be a global space law.\u201d\nOne concern expressed by European industry is how the law will be applied. \u201cWe need to be careful first to have something that is harmonized across Europe,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Derrey, president and chief executive of Thales Alenia Space, on another conference panel, \u201cbut also to make sure we are on the playing field with the rest of the world.\u201d\nHe and others argued that the law needs to apply not just to European companies but to foreign companies seeking to operate in the EU. Kavvada reassured them that is the goal of the proposed law. \u201cThe intent is to create a competitive advantage of the European industrial ecosystem and, therefore, apply to each and every company from a third country who would like to do business in Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, the same rules for the Europeans and for the non-Europeans.\u201d\nDermine said Belgium would work to support the bill through the EU legislative process once released, but cautioned that could take some time. \u201cJust to manage expectations \u2014 I don\u2019t want to disappoint \u2014 it\u2019s highly unlikely we will vote the text in this term,\u201d which ends in June, he said. \u201cWe will work on this to have it ready to go, a legislative package that can be voted in the next presidency with the new commission.\u201d",

(Mark Garlick/Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Black holes are powerful gravitational engines. So you might imagine that there must be a way to extract energy from them given the chance, and you'd be right. Certainly, we could tap into all the heat and kinetic energy of a black hole 's accretion disk and jets, but even if all you had was a black hole in empty space, you could still extract energy from a trick known as the Penrose process. First proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971, it is a way to extract rotational energy from a black hole. It uses an effect known as frame dragging, where a rotating body twists nearby space in such a way that an object falling toward the body is dragged slightly along the path of rotation. We've observed the effect near Earth, though it is tiny. Near a rotating black hole, the effect can be huge. So strong that within a region known as the ergosphere objects can be dragged around the black hole at speeds greater than light in free space. Roughly, the Penrose process is to fly into the ergosphere of a swiftly spinning black hole, and then release a bit of mass or radiation into the black hole. The resulting rotational kick sends you away from the black hole faster than you approached it. The extra energy you get is balanced by slowing down the black hole's rotation. This process can in theory extract up to 20 percent of the black hole's mass energy, which is huge. In comparison, fusing hydrogen into helium only yields about 1 percent of the mass energy. Of course, theoretical physicists are never satisfied. If you can extract 20 percent of the mass energy from a black hole, why not more? This is the focus of a recent paper, though it should be noted that it focuses on a more abstract idea of a black hole than we see in the Universe. Simple black holes can be characterized by three things: mass, rotation, and electric charge. The black holes we observe have the first two, but since matter is electrically neutral, not the third. This paper focuses on charged black holes. Our Universe is also expanding and can be roughly described by a solution to Einstein's equations known as de Sitter space. It describes an empty universe with a positive cosmological constant. Anti-de Sitter space (AdS) would be a universe with a negative cosmological constant. Although AdS doesn't describe our Universe, it allows for a few mathematical tricks theorists love, so it is often used to explore the limits of general relativity . This paper specifically looks at a charged black hole in anti-de Sitter space. Although this study is entirely hypothetical, it's interesting as a \"what-if\" scenario. Rather than extracting energy from a black hole's rotation, the authors look at how to extract energy through particle decay using the Ba\u00f1ados-Silk-West (BSW) effect. Using some kind of electromagnetic or physical confinement mirrors, particles can be reflected back and forth near the event horizon, gaining energy from the black hole until they decay as usable energy. The problem with this idea, as the authors show, is that this can lead to a runaway effect where particle energy amplifies particle energy in a feedback look, leading to what's known as a black hole bomb. So if you find yourself building a power plant near a charged black hole in an anti-de Sitter universe, tread carefully. But more interesting is that the authors also looked at the case of a charged black hole in an otherwise empty anti-de Sitter universe. In this case, energy would also be extracted from the black hole. Instead of mirrors, the structure of space-time itself would act as a kind of confinement chamber. So the charged black hole would release energy on its own. It would be similar to Hawking radiation , but in this case, it doesn't rely upon quantum gravity. The authors also found that this case doesn't lead to a black hole bomb. As mentioned earlier, none of this applies to real black holes in our Universe. As far as we know, the Penrose process is the best we could really do. But studies like this are useful because of what they reveal about the fundamental nature of space and time. And now we know that even in a strange anti-universe we can only imagine, black holes can release energy over time. This article was originally published by Universe Today .

        "body": "Physicists Discover Evidence of Time Being Reversible in Glass Physics 30 January 2024 By Mike McRae (elifesra/Getty Images) Time's inexorable march might well wait for no one, but a new experiment by researchers at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany and Roskilde University in Denmark shows how in some materials it might occasionally shuffle. An investigation into the way substances like glass age has uncovered the first physical evidence of a material-based measure of time being reversible. For the most part the laws of physics care little about time's arrow. Flip an equation describing the movement of an object and you can easily calculate where it started. We describe such laws as time reversible . While many individual laws thumb their nose at time, the fate of our Universe as a whole is dictated by the inevitable pull of chaos. In one direction, freshly laid eggs. In the other, omelets. No amount of calculating will get you a nice, round egg again. In scientific terms, we might say time is a feature of the second law of thermodynamics \u2013 the tendency for isolated systems to be more disordered than they were in the past in ways that can't be easily rewound. What decides whether a material system is time reversible or driven by entropy is hard to say. We can easily imagine the rusting of an old car, the weathering of a statue, or steady decay of a beached ship, yet materials like glass can slowly change in ways that have nothing to do with external corrosive forces. Consisting of liquid-like jumbles of particles, non-crystalline substances that include various polymers and amorphous solids like glass relax into a theoretically stable state according to their own entropy-driven clock. Think of it as a kind of special theory of relativity based not on gravity or acceleration, but the steady reconfiguration of assorted molecules thermodynamically falling into place. Physicists describe this measure of aging as material time. While the concept has been around since the early 1970s , its interpretation in what's known as the Tool\u2013Narayanaswamy formalism has never been experimentally measured. There's a good reason for this. Glass ages slowly in ways that can't be captured simply by watching it closely. \"It was a huge experimental challenge,\" says lead author Till B\u00f6hmer, a condensed matter physicist from the Technical University of Darmstadt. The team made clever use of a highly sensitive video camera to record scattered laser light, which, upon hitting a glass sample, formed interference patterns that could be statistically interpreted as fluctuations that conveyed a sense of material time within three different glass-forming substances. Rather than being locked on a path towards equilibrium, they found evidence of time being reversible on a molecular level, varying as particles pushed and pulled one another into new arrangements. Rewind the entire process, it becomes impossible to tell whether the movie is being played forward or in reverse. \"However, this does not mean that the aging of materials can be reversed,\" says B\u00f6hmer. As a whole, the system is destined to settle into a state as determined by entropy. Yet the tiny swings of the molecular pendulums don't contribute to this process, tick-tocking back and forth, seemingly without a thought to the tides of time that surround them. This research was published in Nature Physics .",

        "body": "Embryo Development Linked to a 500-Million-Year-Old Viral Infection Nature 30 January 2024 By David Nield (Serhii Brovko/Getty Images) A critical early stage of embryonic development has been linked to a virus that mixed with the ancestral DNA of complex organisms like ourselves more than 500 million years ago. Genetic material from endogenous retroviruses \u2013 which infected the earliest organisms on Earth, leaving markers in our DNA \u2013 is estimated to make up around 8 to 10 percent of the modern human genome. The newly discovered link between these viruses and embryo growth has implications for creating artificial embryos and working on regenerative medicines , according to researchers from the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol\u00f3gicas, or CNIO). The researchers looked at cells in the earliest stages of mouse embryo formation. (de la Rosa et al., Science Advances , 2024) \"Until recently, these viral remnants were considered to be junk DNA , genetic material that was unusable or even harmful,\" says biologist Sergio de la Rosa, from CNIO. \"Intuitively, it was thought that having viruses in the genome could not be good.\" Through a detailed study of mouse models, the team was able to identify a retroviral protein called MERVL-gag, which helps manage the pace of embryo development just a few hours after fertilization. The key development in question is when the first few totipotent cells (capable of becoming any of the cells that form the entire organism) give rise to pluripotent cells (capable of becoming cells that form any tissues of the body, but not placental tissue). This gradual process of specialization in the embryo is what turns a blob of cells into either a cat, a sea cucumber, an earthworm, or a human being, and the researchers showed how MERVL-gag influences a gene called URI \u2013 thought to be essential in enabling molecules to become pluripotent. \"It is a totally new role for endogenous retroviruses,\" says Djouder. \"We discovered a new mechanism that explains how an endogenous retrovirus directly controls pluripotency factors.\" The team found high levels of expression of the MERVL-gag protein in the early totipotency phase of embryo growth, with these levels then steadily decreasing as URI becomes more influential on the behavior of cells. What we're seeing here is a careful balance between proteins, genes, and pluripotency, the result of hundreds of millions of years of evolution , and none of it would be possible without an ancient virus. This step in the process from the first few cells to an actual living animal is hugely important in successfully developing artificial embryos too, research which helps in understanding problems that can affect pregnancy and fertility. \"We are starting to realize that these retroviruses, which have co-evolved with us over millions of years, have important functions, such as regulating other genes,\" says de la Rosa. \"It's an extremely active field of research.\" The research has been published in Science Advances .",

        "body": "Virus That Murders Sleeping Bacteria Could Be Used to Assassinate Superbugs Health 30 January 2024 By David Nield Illustration of the Paride phage. (Fabienne Estermann & Enea Maffei/ETH Zurich) After six years of searching, researchers from the University of Basel and ETH Zurich in Switzerland have found what might be a crucial weapon in the fight against superbugs : viruses that are able to prey on and kill dangerous bacteria while they're in a dormant state. Bacteria go into this sleep mode when they're low on nutrients or under various kinds of stress. It's a form of self-protection, which means the bacteria can't spread or grow. Yet existing in a shut-down state also protects them from threats that hijack their engines, such as viruses or antibiotics . Bacteria actually spend a lot of time in this inactive state. Up until now, all efforts to discover a type of bacteria-infecting virus (or bacteriophage ) that could wipe out hibernating bacteria had been unsuccessful. \"In view of the huge number of bacteriophages, however, I was always convinced that evolution must have produced some that can crack into dormant bacteria,\" says microbiologist Alexander Harms from the University of Basel. That conviction has now paid off. Harms and his team identified a previously undiscovered phage that they're calling Paride, and which was found on rotting plant material in a Swiss cemetery. The phage is able to tackle the common bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , found in a variety of environments including hospitals. If it infects the human body, it can trigger serious respiratory diseases, such as potentially fatal forms of pneumonia . Crucially, when Paride was combined with the antibiotic meropenem , it was able to kill off 99 percent of P. aeruginosa in lab tests. In experiments on mice, the phage and antibiotic were also effective at destroying bacteria \u2013 but only in combination. \"This shows that our discovery is not just a laboratory artifact, but could also be clinically relevant,\" says microbiologist Enea Maffei from the University of Basel. With bacteria and the resulting infections becoming increasingly resistant to the drugs we've developed to tackle them, enlisting the help of viruses to batter bugs even when they're in self-protective mode could be a significant breakthrough. The researchers aren't fully sure how this is working, but it seems as though the virus might be using some kind of molecular key to trick P. aeruginosa and unlock its defenses, which then allows the antibiotic to do its work . Scientists are becoming increasingly interested in using phages to destroy drug-resistant bacteria \u2013 or superbugs \u2013 and now we have one that works in a bacteria's dormant stage. However, a lot of study and hard work remains ahead. \"We're just at the beginning,\" says Harms. \"The one thing we know for sure is that we know almost nothing.\" The research has been published in Nature Communications .",

        "body": "FDA Warns of 'Gas Station Heroin' Supplements. Here's Why They're a Growing Concern. Health 30 January 2024 By C. Michael White, The Conversation (Veniamin Blaga / 500px/Getty Images) The Food and Drug Administration is upping the urgency of its warnings for consumers to avoid purchasing or consuming tianeptine \u2013 commonly called \"gas station heroin\" \u2013 a synthetic drug typically sold in tablet or powder form and available for purchase online as well as in convenience stores, gas stations and smoke shops. It is the active ingredient in products such as Neptune's Fix , Za Za Red and Tianaa. Tianeptine, which is approved in some countries as a prescription drug for the treatment of depression , can mimic the actions of opioids like fentanyl. As a result, it carries similar risks of addiction, withdrawal and overdose potential . It can also lead to psychosis , seizures, kidney damage and death . The FDA has been actively urging US consumers to avoid the drug since 2022. But vendors continue to promote the drug as a dietary supplement , despite the fact that the FDA has explicitly stated that tianeptine \"does not meet the statutory definition of a dietary ingredient and is an unsafe food additive.\" The Conversation asked pharmacist C. Michael White, who studies the harmful effects of substances of abuse and natural products, to explain the growing health risk to consumers of products containing tianeptine. What is tianeptine and why is it risky? Tianeptine stimulates the same receptors as well-known opioids such as fentanyl, heroin and morphine. When these drugs make their way from the blood to the brain, they bind to the \"mu\" type opioid receptor that triggers the sought-after pain relief and euphoria of those drugs as well as the dangerous effects like slowed or stopped breathing. High doses of tianeptine can bring euphoric effects similar to heroin and can also bring about the dissociative effect \u2013 the perception of your mind being disconnected from your surroundings and body \u2013 that is reminiscent of ketamine , an anesthetic that has a role in treating post-traumatic stress disorder and depression but has also commonly been abused as a street drug. Products containing tianeptine are often called \" legal high drugs \" \u2013 sometimes dubbed \"gas station drugs\" \u2013 a term used for all non-FDA-approved synthetic drugs that are sold casually in gas stations , online and elsewhere. frameborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen> What are the major adverse effects that people can experience? Data from clinical trials , case reports and poison control centers shows that tianeptine commonly induces agitation. This is typically accompanied by a fast heart rate and high blood pressure, confusion, nightmares, drowsiness, dry mouth and nausea, among other conditions. The most serious adverse events are slowed or stopped breathing, coma, heart arrhythmia and death. When long-term users try to stop tianeptine use, they often experience withdrawal symptoms reminiscent of opioid withdrawal. Consumers need to be aware that products containing tianeptine may not adhere to good manufacturing practices . This means they could contain lead or have other heavy metal contamination or be contaminated by microorganisms such as salmonella or mold. They could also contain other drug ingredients that are not disclosed. Knowingly or unknowingly combining active ingredients can increase the risk of adverse events. Additionally, the amount of the active ingredient contained in the product can vary widely, even with the same manufacturer. So past use does not guarantee that using the same amount will provide the same effect. How are these drugs sold in the US if they are not FDA-approved? If a drug product is not FDA-approved for prescription or over-the-counter-use , it is the Drug Enforcement Agency that is responsible for controlling market access. Before the DEA can ban an active ingredient in a drug product, it must be designated Schedule I , meaning the drug has no legitimate medical purpose and has high abuse potential. Manufacturers do not have to alert the DEA before selling their products to US citizens. This means the DEA must detect an issue, identify the products causing the issue, identify the active ingredients in the product in question and do a full scientific review before designating it as Schedule I. Tianeptine came to market masquerading as a dietary supplement in gas stations and smoke shops, even though it is a synthetic compound. Tianeptine is also sold online allegedly for research purposes and not for human consumption . Tianeptine is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of pain and depression, but sellers do nothing to make this type of labeling clear to consumers or to restrict purchases to researchers. frameborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-sha",

        "body": "Want to Get More Exercise? Maybe Leave Your Spouse Behind Health 30 January 2024 By David Nield (xavierarnau/E+/Getty Images) If you need a boost to hit your health and fitness goals, you might want to consider ditching your partner, in a loving way. A new study shows older couples exercising together are less active overall than those who exercise separately. Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore crunched the numbers on 240 people aged 54 to 72 years old, using fitness trackers to record data such as daily steps and calories burned for 12 weeks. \"Those who participated with their spouses had lower mean and median step counts and met daily step counts of 10,000 and 15,000 less frequently than those who participated by themselves,\" write the researchers in their published paper. The science isn't all that clear-cut on this issue. Previous studies have found that exercising with others can make activities more enjoyable, and add accountability and extra motivation to an exercise regime. With the current research, the team behind it suggests that the lower activity levels for couples exercising together are linked to well-established habits and routines, and people being set in their ways \u2013 rather than people taking it easier or cutting activities short. In other words, setting a goal of 10,000 steps a day is easier for one person than for two: with two people, both need to find the time in the day and the motivation to get the activity on the agenda. \"For these couples, changing daily habits could require a major reshuffling of set habits and routines ingrained in their family life after years of marriage,\" says Sapphire Lin, a health scientist at NTU. \"This makes incorporating exercise difficult, and could lead to a demotivating effect.\" We know that the global population continues to get older in general, and it's also been well established how important exercise is to staying healthy \u2013 which especially applies in our later years as the body winds down. It's clear that our bodies only have a finite lifespan, with physical and mental issues mounting up as we get older, but there's plenty of evidence that keeping active can help slow down some of this decline. This study offers some interesting insights into the best ways for older adults to stay fit , while also revealing that those who were given personalized feedback from their fitness tracker app ended up being more active. \"Our research suggests that older adults looking to introduce exercise into their lifestyles may find it more effective to focus on changing their own routines rather than attempting to exercise as a couple and seeking to impose changes on their partner,\" says Lin. The research has been published in the International Journal of Human\u2013Computer Interaction .",

        "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 A SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully launched a Northrop Cygnus cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station for the first time Jan. 30.\nThe Falcon 9 lifted off at 12:07 p.m. Eastern from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. It deployed into orbit nearly 15 minutes later a Cygnus cargo spacecraft on the NG-20 commercial resupply station to the ISS. The Falcon 9 first stage returned for a landing at Cape Canaveral to complete its tenth flight.\nThe launch was the first time Cygnus launched on a Falcon 9. Most previous Cygnus missions launched on Northrop Grumman\u2019s own Antares rocket, other than two that launched on United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 vehicles after an Antares launch failure in 2014.\nNorthrop procured three Falcon 9 launches for Cygnus while it works with Firefly Aerospace on the Antares 330, a new version of the rocket that replaces the Ukrainian-built first stage and Russian-manufactured engines with a stage and engines produced by Firefly. That vehicle is slated to begin launches as soon as mid-2025.\nNorthrop said at a Jan. 26 briefing that they made few changes to the Cygnus spacecraft or its processing flow to accommodate the switch to the Falcon 9. SpaceX said at the same briefing that they did modify the Falcon 9 payload fairing to add a door, enabling access to the Cygnus spacecraft for the late load of cargo just before launch.\nThe spacecraft, named by Northrop \u201cS.S. Patricia \u2018Patty\u2019 Hilliard Robertson\u201d after the late NASA astronaut, is scheduled to arrive at the station and be berthed by the Canadarm2 robotic arm early Feb. 1. Cygnus will remain at the station for at least 100 days.\nThe Cygnus is carrying 3,726 kilograms of cargo for the ISS, split almost evenly among crew supplies, science investigation and vehicle hardware. The research payloads range from biological research to demonstrations of a surgical robot system inside the station and robotic arms from Japanese company GITAI outside the station.\nAmong the payloads is Hewlett Packard\u2019s Enterprise\u2019s Spaceborne Computer-2. The computer is designed to analyze data from other investigations on the station using artificial intelligence and machine learning without the need to transmit large volumes of data to the ground. \u201cI can compute faster than you can download,\u201d said Mark Fernandez, principal investigator, during a Jan. 26 briefing.\nThe computer is an upgraded version of one previously flown on the station, with a new operating system and four 30-terabyte solid state drives. \u201cWe will be able to store any and all of the raw data you generate up there, process it and get your insights back down to Earth faster and better than ever,\u201d he said.\nLambdaVision, a company developing artificial retinas best produced in microgravity, is flying its ninth experiment to the station on NG-20. \u201cWe have refined our manufacturing process over the last eight missions. We\u2019re now looking at making this process scalable,\u201d said Nicole Wagner, chief executive of LambdaVision,\n\u201cIn the past couple of flights we have looked at scale: how do we take everything that we have learned to date and build on that so we can generate more artificial retinas,\u201d she said, as her company considers future production on the ISS or commercial successors.\nVehicle hardware on NG-20 includes a kit for later installation of another set of iROSA solar arrays outside the station as well as spare parts for the station components such as the oxygen generator and exercise equipment. \u201cAll these spares are essentially spare parts for future repairs,\u201d said Dina Contella, operations integration manager for the ISS at NASA, at a Jan. 26 briefing, rather that equipment that needs repair now.\nAs with other cargo missions, NASA is using NG-20 to provide the crew with an assortment of fresh food, from hazelnut spread to hummus. \u201cLots of ice cream,\u201d Contella added.",

PERTE is the Spanish acronym for Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation, a broader post-pandemic recovery effort.\nThe company won the funding after completing the preliminary design review (PDR) its Miura 5 small launch vehicle, a review that was then examined by an independent committee. The award is technically a loan, which will be paid off over 10 years once Miura 5 begins commercial operations, currently scheduled for 2026.\n\u201cThe technical decision in favor of PLD Space confirms that our technological development strategy is sound and is based on a solid business plan,\u201d said Ezequiel S\u00e1nchez, executive president of PLD Space, in a statement. \u201cWinning this public contract to create a strategic national capability reinforces our position as a leading company in securing Europe\u2019s access to space.\u201d\nMiura 5 is a small launch vehicle with a payload of up to 540 kilograms to low Earth orbit. The vehicle\u2019s first stage is designed to be recovered through ocean splashdown and reused. Test flights are scheduled to begin as soon as 2025 from a launch site in French Guiana.\nThe vehicle builds on PLD Space\u2019s experience developing the Miura 1, a suborbital rocket. That rocket flew for the first time in October from a Spanish military base, and the company declared that launch a success.\n\u201cWe are fully focused on Miura 5 now,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said in an interview in November. At the time, he said the company was working to complete the PDR by the end of the year, incorporating data from the Miura 1 flight.\nIn the statement about the Spanish government funding, PLD Space said it is now working on tests of components of the TEPREL-C engine that will power the rocket, as well as opening a new headquarters facility that will host initial production of the Miura 5. Work on the launch pad on French Guiana will begin in the second half of the year. To support that work, PLD Space plans to nearly double its workforce from its current 165 employees to 300 by the end of the year.\nThe company has not disclosed the projected cost of developing Miura 5.

The companies will be eligible to compete for task orders for launching individual missions.\nThat effort is seen as a first step to opening up a wider array of European institutional launches to competition. After a Space Summit meeting in November in Seville, Spain, ESA announced plans for a \u201clauncher challenge\u201d that would eventually lead to competition for a wider array of missions.\nIn a separate statement Jan. 26, PLD Space said that it met with members of the European Parliament to discuss those efforts.

(Athena345T/Getty Images) Balmy summer nights alive with the sounds of cicadas are so relaxing, until all manner of unruly insects swarm your lights. As much of a nuisance as this may be to us, what's happening to them is far worse. Imperial College London zoologist Samuel Fabian and colleagues used advanced videography techniques to discover centuries of rumored affairs between moths and flames were never true. Rather than aiming for the intense glow, the poor insects are minding their own business, conducting vital nightly tasks like pollination , when a blaring burst of light messes with their sense of up and down. Flight attitude is a measure of angle compared to Earth's horizon \u2013 kind of critical for keeping on track in the air. I nsects evolved mechanisms for attitude correction based on the fact that throughout time, the sky has been significantly brighter than the land. So when presented with a competing light source, flies, moths, beetles and so on find themselves in an erratic spiral of continued course corrections, giving the illusion of an infatuation with your porch light. \"Contrary to the expectation of attraction, insects do not steer directly toward the light,\" the team described . \"Instead, insects turn their [back] toward the light, generating flight bouts perpendicular to the source.\" Clashing with other signals for orientation, like gravity, the mixed messages give the unfortunate animals vertigo. It can trick wasps into crashing into things and send dragonflies plummeting towards the ground. Diagrams of insect travel around light sources. Insects did not head directly toward the light but orbited around it. (Fabian et al., Nature Communications , 2024) Humans have taken advantage of this light trap for centuries, with the Roman Empire back around 1 CE providing our earliest known written record. Many theories for this phenomenon have since arisen, including that insects must use the Moon for navigation, or are attracted to thermal radiation from globes, but until now our technological limits kept the truth out of our reach. \"3D tracking of small flying objects in low light is technically challenging, and necessary tools did not exist,\" Fabian and team write in their paper . \"We leveraged advances in camera hardware and tracking software to consider the sensory requirements for insect flight control, and how artificial light may disrupt them.\" The researchers recorded 477 instances of different types of insects flying near artificial light, to discover repeating patterns of behavior that spun them in disoriented doom spirals or crash courses. However, if the wind threw them off course they were often able to escape. The orbiting behavior of insects flying around a light source. (Fabian et al., Nature Communications , 2024) The researchers then tested different lighting scenarios and found overhead light sources can allow insects to avoid lower light traps. But their findings only relate to how insects behave around close light sources. To help mitigate the disastrous decline of insects globally , which light pollution contributes to, Fabian and colleagues recommend examining the long distance impacts of our lights at this level of detail as well. \"Taken together, reducing unnecessary, unshielded, upward-facing lights and ground reflections can mitigate the impact on flying insects at night, when skylight cannot compete with artificial sources,\" they conclude . The team's findings put an ironic spin on the saying \"drawn like a moth to a flame,\" given these animals sure as heck don't want to be there and are desperately doing all that they can, yet still often fail, to escape. This research was published in Nature Communications .",

The latest launches, including optical and radar surveillance spacecraft, have U.S. officials dismissing China\u2019s claims that these satellites serve mostly civilian and commercial purposes.\nSpeaking Jan. 30 at the Space Mobility Conference, Chief Master Sgt. Ron Lerch, of the Space Systems Command\u2019s intelligence directorate, said China\u2019s rapidly advancing military space-based reconnaissance capabilities are worrisome.\nLerch said U.S. analysts have been following the recent spate of Chinese remote-sensing satellite missions and piecing together open source intelligence, and warned that these spacecraft are providing the People\u2019s Liberation Army unprecedented eyes in space to track U.S. and allies\u2019 activities in Asia-Pacific and other hotspots.\nHe noted that China in recent years has deployed a large number of reconnaissance satellites. But Lerch specifically mentioned China\u2019 launch in December of the classified Yaogan-41 optical satellite to geostationary orbit, a September launch of a trio of Yaogan-39 reconnaissance spacecraft, and the August launch of what is thought to be the world\u2019s first geosynchronous orbit synthetic aperture radar satellite, the Ludi Tance-4.

        "body": "Gut Inflammation Linked to Alzheimer's Disease, Yet Again Health 31 January 2024 By Tessa Koumoundouros (Science Photo Library/Canva) Researchers connecting pieces of the massive Alzheimer's puzzle are closer to slotting the next one in place, with yet another link between our guts and brain. Recent animal studies have demonstrated Alzheimer's can be passed on to young mice through a transfer of gut microbes , confirming a link between the digestive system and the health of the brain. A new study adds further support to the theory that inflammation could be the mechanism through which this occurs. \"We showed people with Alzheimer's disease have more gut inflammation, and among people with Alzheimer's, when we looked at brain imaging, those with higher gut inflammation had higher levels of amyloid plaque accumulation in their brains,\" says University of Wisconsin psychologist Barbara Bendlin. University of Wisconsin pathologist Margo Heston and an international team of researchers tested for fecal calprotectin , a sign of inflammation, in stool samples of 125 individuals recruited from two Alzheimer's prevention cohort studies. Participants underwent several cognitive tests on enrollment, as well as interviews on family history and tests for a high-risk Alzheimer's gene. A subset took clinical tests for signs of amyloid protein clumps, a common indication that pathology responsible for the neurodegenerative condition was underway. While levels of calprotectin were generally higher in older patients, it was even more pronounced in those with Alzheimer's characteristic amyloid plaques. Levels of other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers also increased with levels of inflammation, and memory test scores dropped with higher calprotectin too. Even the participants without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's had poorer memory scores with higher levels of calprotectin. \"We can't infer causality from this study; for that, we need to do animal studies,\" cautions Heston. A laboratory analysis has previously shown gut bacteria chemicals can stimulate inflammatory signals in our brains. What's more, other studies have found increased gut inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's compared to controls. Heston and colleagues suspect microbiome changes trigger gut changes that lead to system-wide inflammation. This inflammation is mild but chronic, causing subtle, incremental damage that eventually interferes with the sensitivity of our body's barriers. \"Increased gut permeability could result in higher blood levels of inflammatory molecules and toxins derived from gut lumen, leading to systemic inflammation, which in turn may impair the blood-brain barrier and may promote neuroinflammation, and potentially neural injury and neurodegeneration,\" says University of Wisconsin bacteriologist Federico Rey. The researchers are now testing mice to see if diet changes associated with increased inflammation can trigger the rodent version of Alzheimer's. Despite decades of research there's still no effective treatment for the millions of people with Alzheimer's worldwide. But with a greater understanding of the biological processes, scientists are getting closer, piece by piece. This research has been published in Scientific Reports .",

        "body": "Stunning Prehistoric Jewelry Reveals 9 Hidden Societies in Ice Age Europe Humans 31 January 2024 By Clare Watson (Baker et al., Nature Human Behaviour, 2024) For eons, humans have worn personal ornaments that tether them to their people; precious items that reflect a clan identity through life and into the grave. But those cultural associations don't always follow family lines. A new study comparing thousands of pendants from across ice age Europe, dating to between 34,000 and 24,000 years ago, suggests there were at least nine distinct cultural groups of hunter-gatherers within the broader population referred to as the Gravettians, each with their own relatively distinct styles of ornament. Additional analyses of genetic data from burial sites reveal that some of these categories shared the same cultural embellishments even though they were of different ancestries. \"We've shown that you can have two [distinct] genetic groups of people who actually share a culture,\" Jack Baker, lead author of the study and archeology doctoral student at the University of Bordeaux in France, told Scientific American's Sarah Wild . The earliest known instance of ancient humans adorning themselves with beads dates back to around 140,000 years ago , with shell beads found in modern-day Morocco. But the practice of wearing beads really exploded about 45,000 years ago, when ornamental traditions spread across Europe. \"This is the moment when personal ornaments acquire a degree of diversity, enabling researchers to more precisely investigate their role as cultural markers,\" Baker and colleagues explain in their paper . To investigate, Baker compiled existing records of thousands of hand-chiseled beads and pendants found at 112 sites dotted across Europe, from Portugal to Russia. Based on their age and other associated artifacts, these ornaments had previously been lumped together as one culture, the Gravettian people. Best known for their venus figures, including the Venus of Willendorf , this widespread population thrived across Europe for around 10,000 years before dying out before the peak of the last ice age. But the diversity of ornaments, once collated en masse, was striking. The researchers identified 134 different types of beads that the Gravettians had crafted from animal bones, teeth, shells, amber, and stone. Some resembled fishtails; others owls. Gravettian pendants made of animal teeth (left panel) and shaped from bones, ivory, stone, and amber (right panel). ( Baker et al., Nature Human Behaviour , 2024 ) While most of the trinkets were found in the ruins of Gravettian dwellings, some were excavated from burial sites where DNA samples had also been collected. Comparing ornaments across geographical distances, Baker and colleagues identified nine distinct cultural groups with unique preferences for different types of beads depending on their geography. Baker says these differences had ' crystalized ' in the artifacts found in graves, and could have been worn as a way for people to quickly identify each other. The nine cultural groups identified based on ornaments found at dwelling sites (shaded dots) and burial sites (shaded squares). ( Baker et al., Nature Human Behaviour , 2024 ) However, the analysis also suggests that cultural boundaries were at times fluid, with neighboring groups occasionally swapping styles. Moreover, when the patterns among artifacts were layered over genetic evidence, a more complex story emerged. The researchers identified two distinct cultural groups in modern-day Italy where DNA evidence had suggested only one existed. And, in another region, spanning present-day France and Belgium, individuals of different genetic backgrounds decorated themselves with the same types of cultural keepsakes. Researchers have previously cautioned against muddling archeological and genetic evidence. However, archeologist Peter Jordan from Lund University and Hokkaido University has lauded Baker and colleagues' paper as a \" landmark study \" that reveals how examining ancient artifacts and DNA in tandem can reveal rich tapestries of cultural behaviors and group relations that aren't detectable by studying either DNA or artifacts alone. The findings also strike a chord that even during bleak ice ages, our ancestors whittled and carved beautiful pendants to identify their people and distinguish themselves from others, Baker says . \"The sense of belonging felt by all humans today is deeply rooted in our shared history and played an important role in determining how Gravettian people adorned themselves,\" the team concludes . The study has been published in Nature Human Behaviour .",

The team behind the chip, from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, says that it will have an important role to play in testing the safety of cancer treatments, which have been shown to risk heart damage while fighting cancer cells. Noteworthy upgrades over previous heart-chip models include the maturity of the cells that the team developed from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and its ability to beat much like a human heart \u2013 at around 60 beats per minute. An image of the chip with week-old heart cells. (Mozneb et al., Lab on a Chip , 2024) \"Ultimately, multi-lineage, hiPSC-based systems such as the heart-chip presented here may reduce reliance on animal models that are traditionally used for preclinical drug cardiotoxicity testing,\" the researchers write in their published paper. Capable of transforming into any type of cell, hiPSCs were engineered to become heart cells and blood vessel cells before being put onto a flexible silicone material called polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS. A crucial part of the heart chip design is its two parallel channels, which enable the heart cells ( cardiomyocytes ) and blood vessel cells ( endothelial cells ) to be kept separate as they are in a human body while still close enough to interact. By simulating the flow of blood and the mechanical movements of the heart in response to certain drug treatments, scientists can predict potential toxicity problems that could cause arrhythmia or the death of muscle cells. \"The heart-chip platform we have developed enables the screening of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents on multiple cardiovascular cell types in a physiologically-relevant model,\" write the researchers. The heart-chip remained functional for several weeks, offering the opportunity for longer-term investigations into how drugs and other environmental factors influence the heart. As well as helping in the development of safer drugs, the heart-on-a-chip should also be able to teach scientists more about the intricacies of heart disease \u2013 how it starts and progresses, and how it might be treated. In recent years we've seen a steady stream of improvements in the way these chips are developed and produced, providing super-precise simulations of how parts of the human body react on the smallest scales. \"These results suggest that heart-chips can be used for drug toxicity screening and may unveil potential cell-type specific toxicities in response to cardiotoxic compounds,\" write the researchers.

Deep Sea Vision (DSV), a South Carolina-based firm, said the image was captured after an extensive search in an area of the Pacific to the west of Earhart's planned destination, remote Howland Island. Earhart went missing while on a pioneering round-the-world flight with navigator Fred Noonan. Her disappearance is one of the most tantalizing mysteries in aviation lore, fascinating historians for decades and spawning books, movies and theories galore. The prevailing belief is that Earhart, 39, and Noonan, 44, ran out of fuel and ditched their twin-engine Lockheed Electra in the Pacific near Howland Island while on one of the final legs of their epic journey. DSV said the blurry image captured by an unmanned underwater submersible at a depth of 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) using side scan sonar \"reveals contours that mirror the unique dual tails and scale of her storied aircraft.\" On July 2, 1937, Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan took off from Papua New Guinea, nearing the end of their record-setting journey around the world never to be seen again.

DSV said the exploration team spent 90 days searching 5,200 square miles (13,500 square kilometers) of the Pacific Ocean floor, \"more than all previous searches combined.\" DSV said it is keeping the exact location of the find confidential for now and is planning further search efforts. But Romeo said the discovery was made applying what is known as the \"Date Line theory\" first advanced in 2010 by Liz Smith, a former NASA employee. This theory posits that Noonan forgot to turn the calendar back a day as they flew over the International Date Line, resulting in a miscalculation of his celestial star navigation and a westward navigational error of 60 miles (100 kilometers). Earhart, who won fame in 1932 as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, took off on May 20, 1937 from Oakland, California, hoping to become the first woman to fly around the world. She and Noonan vanished on July 2, 1937 after taking off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, on a challenging 2,500-mile (4,000-kilometer) flight to refuel on Howland Island, a speck of a US territory between Australia and Hawaii.

        "body": "Elon Musk Says Neuralink Has Implanted First Ever Human Brain Chip Tech 31 January 2024 By Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert, Business Insider (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Elon Musk on Monday claimed in a post on X that a Neuralink brain implant has, for the first time, been inserted into a human patient's brain. \"The first human received an implant from @Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well,\" Musk wrote . \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\" The first product is called Telepathy, Musk said in a follow-up post , adding that the device \"enables control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking. Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs.\" \"Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer,\" he continued. \"That is the goal.\" Musk previously said the Neuralink device would record and stimulate brain activity, acting as a \"Fitbit in your skull,\" and claimed the implant would eventually \"solve\" conditions including autism and schizophrenia . Business Insider's Hilary Brueck reported in 2019 that neuroscientists believe Neuralink won't likely be able to \"solve\" mental health conditions or change the developmental architecture of the brain when it is impacted by diseases like Alzheimer's . However, the technology may be effective at stimulating electrodes, thereby helping paralyzed patients achieve better mobility or helping blind patients to see. Representatives for Neuralink did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Years in the making The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been promising that Neuralink would soon begin testing on humans since 2019. The FDA initially rejected Neuralink's request for approval to test its brain chips in humans last March, citing concerns that they could overheat or move in the brain, Reuters reported. Approval was ultimately granted in May 2023. The approval prompted thousands of prospective patients to sign up as volunteers to have a portion of their skull removed and the implant inserted. When the company began recruiting for its first human trial in September, Neuralink said in a blog post that it was seeking patients with spinal cord injuries who have paralysis in all four limbs or who have been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. While Neuralink says it hopes to help people with neurological disorders with its implanted devices, the company also aims to eventually develop an implant that will allow people to send messages or play games using only their thoughts. Musk, who in 2022 claimed he plans to implant one of the chips in his own brain someday, has said he aims to create such a powerful interface through Neuralink that it will enable humans to process information faster, speed up cognition, and \"achieve a sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence .\" But some experts are skeptical. In 2019, Business Insider's Brueck spoke to Columbia University neuroscientist Randy Bruno, who said he was unsure that Neuralink could ever facilitate such super-enhanced thinking power due to the basic function of the brain. \"Neurons work at a certain speed,\" Bruno, a researcher who implants probes into mouse brains, said. \"I think that's ultimately going to be limiting.\" Others have raised concerns over the ethics of the technology and its development, and Musk's promises about what Neuralink will be able to do. \"We should, of course, hope that the intervention ultimately functions as advertised with few potential adverse side-effects,\" Jason T. Eberl, professor and director of the Albert Gnaegi Center for Health Care Ethics at Saint Louis University, told Healthline in 2022 . \"However, any for-profit medical device company also has a vested interest in generating a consumer base, which is why they make the sometimes grandiose claims they do.\" This article was originally published by Business Insider .

        "body": "2,000-Year-Old Bones Undermine Myth About Columbus And Syphilis Health 31 January 2024 By Carly Cassella Pre-Columbian skeleton in Brazil. (Jose Filippini) In 1493, the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus returned to Europe after his famous journey to the Americas. Just a year or two later, a plague broke out among French soldiers in Italy that quickly spread to other parts of the continent and came to be called the ' Great Pox '. So began Europe's first known outbreak of syphilis. Historians have long debated where this highly contagious infection came from, and the timing of Columbus' return, along with racist and xenophobic ideologies , had many pointing the finger at the New World. Now, an international team of researchers has uncovered the oldest case of a syphilis-like disease, and it seriously undermines the so-called Columbian hypothesis. Genetic analysis of 2,000-year-old bones found in Brazil has revealed an ancient bacterial subspecies of syphilis, which also causes bone lesions. This bacterial species belongs to the genus Treponema, same as the bacteriaum that causes syphilis, but it is most closely related to another modern pathogen that causes a disease called bejel . Bejel is a treponemal disease spread via skin contact and is not just sexually transmitted. Like syphilis, the disease can affect the skin and deeper tissues, including bone. Today, bejel is mostly reported in arid parts of Africa, western Asia, and Mediterranean regions. The discovery of a bejel-like disease in pre-Columbian Brazil is a surprise. It suggests that while treponemal diseases existed in South America a thousand years before Columbus' arrival, they were not the same as the venereal disease that later struck Europe. \"The fact that the findings represent an endemic type of treponemal diseases, and not sexually transmitted syphilis, leaves the origin of the sexually transmitted syphilis still unsettled,\" says environmental scientist Kerttu Majander from the University of Basel. Since the early twentieth century , historians and scientists alike have argued over where syphilis came from, and even to this day, the debate continues to center around Columbus, despite the' specious beginnings of the hypothesis. In recent years, some scientists have started to find genetic hints of syphilis in the bones and teeth of Europeans that lived long before Columbus, though some experts have been unconvinced by these discoveries. Part of the problem is that syphilis and other pathogens in the Treponema genus have really similar manifestations when they infect humans, which can be easily conflated without genetic analysis. Reliable dating of human remains has also been a problem. The current study in Brazil makes up for both those limitations. Finding an ancient bejel-like disease in a humid area far from the arid homelands of its modern counterpart suggests that the earliest treponemes were widespread and able to adapt to various climates and geographic locations. Some human bones found in a Mexican cave show lesions like syphilis that date back 9,900 years. Perhaps they were also caused by a bejel-like disease. As it turns out, the origins of syphilis may not be confined to just one place or one time. Perhaps that first outbreak in Europe was due to a mutation in a treponeme that had existed in that area or nearby for millennia. \"As we have not found any sexually transmitted syphilis in South America, the theory that Columbus brought syphilis to Europe seems to appear more improbable,\" explains archaeologist Verena Sch\u00fcnemann, who used to work at the University of Zurich. The team hopes others will continue their work by investigating ancient bacterial DNA in other human remains found elsewhere on the continent. The study was published in Nature .",

It deployed its payload of four satellites for NorthStar Earth and Space into a sun-synchronous orbit at 530 kilometers.\nThe satellites are 16U cubesats built by Spire for NorthStar, with Exolaunch providing mission integration services. They are equipped with sensors to enable them to track objects as small as five centimeters across in low Earth orbit and 40 centimeters across in geostationary orbit.\nThe four satellites are the first in an initial constellation of 12 spacecraft, with the next eight to be launched on two future Electron missions by 2026. NorthStar\u2019s contract with Spire includes options for up to 18 additional spacecraft.\nNorthStar, which raised $15 million in December and $105 million overall, says that when the 12 satellites are in service they will be able to monitor 60% of the sky at any given time, increasing to 100% when combined with other sensors. \u201cNorthStar has patiently invested in the realization of an unprecedented turnkey SSA service designed to outperform the challenges of space congestion and security in space that are mounting exponentially every day,\u201d Stewart Bain, chief executive of NorthStar, said in a Jan. 8 statement.\nThat patience was tested by launch delays. The four satellites were scheduled to launch last year on Virgin Orbit\u2019s LauncherOne system, but that company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023 and was later liquidated. NorthStar then signed a contract with Rocket Lab for a launch in the fall of 2023, only to be delayed when an Electron launch failed in September.\nThis launch, called \u201cFour of a Kind\u201d by Rocket Lab, was the first of the year for the company. It was scheduled for mid-January but delayed by additional pre-launch checkouts and poor weather conditions. The company said in a November earnings call that it had a manifest of 22 Electron launches for 2024, including two of HASTE, a version used for suborbital missions. Rocket Lab conducted 10 Electron launches in 2023.\nRocket Lab also used the launch to test its ability to recover Electron boosters. The booster for this flight descended under a parachute and splashed down 17 minutes after liftoff. A recovery ship arrived shortly after splashdown to pick up the booster and return it to port.\nThe company plans to eventually reuse the boosters, having already launched a booster with a previously flown Rutherford engine in August 2023. Company officials said then that reusing an engine was one the final steps before full booster reuse.\n\u201cThe success of today\u2019s mission to deliver Spire and NorthStar to orbit, and the completion of our secondary mission to return Electron to Earth after launch, has been a fantastic start of what is set to be Rocket Lab\u2019s busiest year ever,\u201d Peter Beck, chief executive of Rocket Lab, said in a statement.",

On one side, companies developing technologies to provide satellite maintenance, repair and other on-orbit services seek an early government commitment to bring about private investment.\nA flagship customer for these services, the U.S. Space Force, has funded development projects and demonstrations, but it\u2019s not ready to become an anchor customer as it continues to define its requirements and realign budgets.\nA clear signal of future demand is needed sooner rather than later, as companies struggle to secure funding based solely on long-term market potential, Robert Hauge, president of SpaceLogistics, said Jan. 30 at the Space Mobility Conference.\nSpaceLogistics, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, provides in-orbit satellite services to commercial companies and is seeking new military customers.\nCol.

There is no one company that is going to solve the space mobility and logistics problem for the entire world,\u201d Martin said at the conference.\nThe adoption of standards will help the industry succeed and in turn \u201chelp provide the solutions that you will need,\u201d said Martin.\nProtecting IP\nStockham noted that some companies are wary of allowing the government to set standards for fear of having to hand over sensitive proprietary data about their products. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s a tension that exists all across government procurement,\u201d he said.\nThe Space Force wants competition in the market, he said. \u201cBut we also have to allow multiple participants in that marketplace to interface together.

However, companies don\u2019t want to share intellectual property that gives them a competitive advantage.\nAn example of that is the \u201cIP that is buried in the algorithms for rendezvous and proximity operations,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to caution against generically lumping everything into an IP term.

        "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Following Northrop Grumman\u2019s recent announcement that its satellite refueling port was selected as the preferred standard for military satellites, a Space Systems Command official said the company\u2019s statement has been misinterpreted as making Northrop the sole provider.\nA Northrop Grumman-designed refueling nozzle for satellites, known as the Passive Refueling Module, underwent a review by the Space Systems Command\u2019s systems systems integration office and was approved for use on high-value national security assets \u2014 but this does not represent a downselect, Col. Joyce Bulson, director of servicing, mobility and logistics, told reporters Jan. 31.\nDuring a meeting with reporters at SpaceCom, an industry conference, Bulson insisted that the command continues to evaluate other refueling solutions for potential use.\nShe explained that Northrop Grumman\u2019s Passive Refueling Module (PRM) was developed with government funding so it went through a specialized assessment as government-owned intellectual property. This led to its approval as a refueling standard for military satellites. However, Bulson stressed, this does not preclude adopting other commercially developed options.\nBulson\u2019s comments suggest there was industry backlash after Northrop\u2019s announcement led some to conclude it had won an exclusive monopoly, and that the selection of PRM could chill commercial investment and innovation.\nCompetition continues\nTo be sure, Northrop Grumman officials when discussing the announcement pointed out that the selection of the PRM was not exclusive.\nThe Space Systems Command intends to continue to promote competition in the industry, Bulson said.\n\u201cThere is a refueling port, the PRM, and there are other refueling ports that we\u2019re looking at and that we have on contract,\u201d said Bulson.\nThe Space Systems Command\u2019s Systems Integration Office reviewed the PRM and recommended it. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything particularly controversial with that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is the first one that has gone through that boarding process because it is a government owned design.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with other partners to evaluate their designs and figure out what\u2019s the best process to get those under review for the larger Space Force community,\u201d Bulson added.\nAcquisition strategy TBD\nBulson noted that many of the details about how the Space Force will procure refueling systems and services remain to be determined, as the service is still sorting through requirements documents and has yet to get funding approved for these efforts.\nThe selection of the PRM as a preferred interface for Space Force satellites suggests that the port would likely be used for the government\u2019s most sensitive national security payloads. Because the government owns the IP, if other companies wanted to compete for refueling contracts they could conceivably seek the technical specs to build a compatible port.\nOther refueling interfaces being developed in the commercial market, such as Orbit Fab\u2019s RAFTI port, are being demonstrated in upcoming experiments, Bulson pointed out.\nOrbit Fab\u2019s CEO Daniel Faber told SpaceNews Jan. 31 that the company next month plans to ship 15 to 20 RAFTI ports to customers, and about half of the ports are for the U.S. Space Force.\n\u201cWe passed design reviews,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are shipping to the government for integration on government missions.

        "body": "6-Million-Year-Old Ape's Ear Suggests We Learned to Walk Upright in 3 Steps Humans 01 February 2024 By Clare Watson (Xiaocong Guo/Chinese Academy of Sciences) From a four-limbed scramble to a two-legged amble \u2013 the knack for strutting our stuff on our hind limbs is one of the more obvious features distinguishing us humans and our ilk from great apes and earlier ancestors. Unfortunately physical evidence of the transition is scarce. With so many possible ways the process could have taken place, it's hard to say with certainty how our anatomy and its mechanical functions evolved. A new study of an ancient ape's inner ear suggests that the evolution of human bipedalism was not a sudden uprising, but a three-part process that bridged the gap between swinging in trees and standing on solid ground. This new evidence comes from skulls of Lufengpithecus , an ape that lived in East Asia around 6 million years ago. Some features of Lufengpithecus ' teeth suggest it was a primitive ancestor of modern-day orangutans, which clamber about in tree canopies. However, other analyses of its skull place Lufengpithecus closer to African apes, such as gorillas and chimpanzees, known for their knuckle-walking. This in-betweenness makes Lufengpithecus an interesting ape to study when the patchiness of the fossil record has meant scientists haven't been able to piece together the sequence of how early humans began to walk. For their new study, Yinan Zhang, a paleontology doctoral student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and colleagues peered inside Lufengpithecus ' ear, which might seem like an odd place to look for evidence of how a long-extinct creature moved. Scientists have been clued into the vestibular system as a way to study how early humans and our relatives moved since at least 1994, when Dutch anatomist Fred Spoor and colleagues scanned the inner ear bones of more than 150 living and extinct primates. The vestibular system of the inner ear, with its three, looping semicircular canals, sends information to the brain about an animal's position and motion in space. The canals are filled with fluid and fine hairs that sense movement, helping with balance. \"The size and shape of the semicircular canals correlate with how mammals, including apes and humans, move around their environment,\" explains Zhang, the first author of the study. The shape of Lufengpithecus ' inner ear was reconstructed from CT scans. ( Xijun Ni/Chinese Academy of Sciences ) Zhang and colleagues digitally scanned three Lufengpithecus fossils excavated in southern China in the 1970s and 1980s, in which the bony labyrinths of the inner ear had been preserved when other parts of the skulls had been crushed. The inner ear's bony labyrinth consists of three semicircular canals at one end, the spiral-shaped cochlea at the other, and the central vestibule in between. \"Using modern imaging technologies, we were able to visualize the internal structure of fossil skulls and study the anatomical details of the semicircular canals to reveal how extinct mammals moved,\" says Zhang. Comparing the size and shape of Lufengpithecus ' inner ear to those of extinct and living apes, including humans, and early human ancestors such as Australopithecus , the researchers were able to piece together a clearer picture of how early human ancestors began to walk. \"Our study points to a three-step evolution of human bipedalism,\" explains Terry Harrison, senior author of the study and New York University anthropologist. Before Lufengpithecus , the earliest apes moved from branch to branch suspended by only their arms, like gibbons do today, Harrison says . Then, Lufengpithecus emerged, representing an intermediary figure who climbed, clambered, and swung through trees while also moving about on four limbs on the ground, and using two limbs when holding onto branches. The analysis suggests that Lufengpithecus closely resembled how the last common ancestor of apes and humans moved around, and it was from this mix of movements that human bipedalism eventually evolved. That conclusion fits well with previous findings that have also suggested bipedalism emerged gradually, with ancestors holding themselves steady on trees and branches as they slowly found their feet. \"Even though humans generated bipedalism during their evolutionary history, we did come from a group of very unusual primates that developed unique ways of moving around their environment,\" Harrison told Laura Baisas at Popular Science . \"So we are an oddity.\" The study has been published in The Innovation .",

(CHRISTOPH BURGSTEDT/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images) The US is dealing with an \" out-of-control \" epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, according to the National Coalition of STD Directors. The warning comes after the release of an annual data report on STIs by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The exasperation of public health officials can be felt in the very first sentence of the online announcement. \"Yet again,\" the CDC website reads , \"more than 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis were reported in the United States.\" Trends in annual reported STI cases from 2018 to 2022. ( CDC ) The most common STI in the US in 2022 was chlamydia, which has remained in the top spot for years now. Nevertheless, it is the recent rise in syphilis that is concerning health officials most. According to CDC data, syphilis cases of all stages have increased by 80 percent in the past five years. While most think of adults contracting STIs, syphilis threatens the lives of babies, too. When a child contracts syphilis from the mother during pregnancy or birth, it is known as congenital syphilis . In 2022, more than 3,700 of these cases were officially reported in the US. That's a 937 percent increase in a single decade. The good news is that syphilis is curable with the right antibiotics . The bad news is that until the infection is diagnosed and treated, it can cause irreversible damage to the body. In babies, syphilis is particularly dangerous , sometimes causing developmental delays, seizures, or even death. In adults, syphilis is spread via vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and it tends to progress in stages. The primary stage usually involves sores around the mouth or genitals, while the secondary stage can trigger rashes on the body and flu-like symptoms, including fever , headache, sore throat, and fatigue. These first two stages are when the infection is most contagious. Rarely does the disease progress to the third stage, which can impact the organs and prove fatal. The fact that early stages of syphilis are increasing by roughly 10 percent a year is highly concerning, and threatens the health of babies nationwide. In just a single year, congenital syphilis cases have increased by 31 percent in the US. Black or African American children were disproportionately affected. While nearly every single state reported a case of congenital syphilis in 2022, the states of Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Louisiana represented 57 percent of all reports. \"Tragically,\" writes Laura Bachmann, the CDC Director for STD Prevention, \"these infections resulted in 282 stillbirths and infant deaths in 2022.\" Such dire outcomes are hardly inevitable. Timely syphilis testing and treatment during pregnancy could have prevented 88 percent of these cases, experts say. So why isn't that happening? \"The STI field has reached a tipping point,\" Bachmann continues . \"We have long known that these infections are common, but we have not faced such severe effects of syphilis in decades. Recent public health emergencies diverted program resources and threatened the health of those already disproportionately affected by STIs. We must move now to pick up the pieces.\" Officials at the CDC are calling for \"swift innovation and collaboration\" from all public health experts who play a role in STI prevention. Their voices are already being joined by numerous health associations, including the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) , the American Sexual Health Association , the American Academy of Family Physicians , and the National Coalition of STD Directors (NCSDDC). \"The CDC's latest STI data shows that our nation is facing a rapidly deteriorating public health crisis with real lives at stake,\" reads a statement from the NCSDDC. \"STIs \u2013 especially syphilis \u2013 will continue to spiral out of control until the administration and Congress provide communities with the funding they need to provide the most basic screening, treatment, and prevention services.\" While President Biden has put together a multi-agency plan to address America's rising STI cases, funding for the endeavor remains uncertain . Last year, NCSDDC Director David Harvey warned that if President Biden continued to cut health funding overall, his gesture toward STI prevention will inevitably fail. \"The Biden administration deserves praise for putting the spotlight on the most severe consequence of the nation's STI epidemic \u2013 congenital syphilis,\" reads the NCSDDC's most recent announcement. \"But we know all too well that federal leadership will prove hollow if communities don't have the funding they need to get the job done.\"",

        "body": "Measles Cases Soaring Worldwide as WHO Reports Alarming 45-Fold Rise in Europe Health 01 February 2024 By Jaya Dantas, The Conversation (phichet chaiyabin/Shutterstock.com) In recent weeks a series of measles alerts have been issued around Australia , including in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , after the identification of a small number of cases in travellers returning from overseas. Meanwhile, places such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been contending with larger measles outbreaks. In fact, the World Health Organization reported a 45-fold increase in measles cases in Europe last year, with 42,200 cases recorded in 2023 compared to 941 in 2022. In South Asia, India and Pakistan have also recently reported outbreaks. So what's the risk of a larger outbreak in Australia? Fortunately it's likely to be quite low \u2013 but ensuring we continue to have high rates of vaccination coverage is crucial. Remind me \u2013 what is measles? Measles is a highly infectious viral disease. It spreads through tiny droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one infected person comes into contact with ten unvaccinated people, they can infect nine of them . It can take around ten to 12 days for symptoms to appear after a person has been exposed to the virus . Although measles is characterised by a rash, symptoms are generally cold-like to begin with, including a fever , runny nose, fatigue, and sore or red eyes. The rash, which is not itchy, emerges two or three days later and spreads from the face down the body. Sometimes measles can lead to secondary infections such as an ear infection, diarrhoea or pneumonia . In rare cases measles can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). In severe cases measles can lead to hospitalisation and death. We saw this in 2019 in the Pacific Island nation of Samoa. Out of 5,667 infections in a four-month period, 81 died, mostly young children. Vaccination works Vaccination is the most effective strategy to protect against measles. Two doses of the MMR vaccine (given to children at 12 months and 18 months in Australia) provide protection against measles, mumps and rubella. Babies under one year have natural protection from their mums that wears off gradually. Infants six to 11 months can be vaccinated if they will be travelling internationally, but will still need to take a further two doses. Once vaccinated, the chance of getting measles is very low and you are considered protected for life. However, about one in 100 people who are vaccinated may still contract measles if they're exposed to the virus. Although it's not entirely clear why this happens, the infection in a vaccinated person is generally mild. Vaccination rates are faltering Globally, there has been a drop in childhood vaccinations over the course of the COVID pandemic . This is likely due to a range of factors including declining trust in vaccines, misinformation and disruptions to access. In Europe, the proportion of children who received a first dose of the MMR vaccine dropped from 96% in 2019 to 93% in 2022, and from 93% to 91% for the second dose. This is important because about 95% vaccination coverage is needed to achieve herd immunity against measles. Under this scenario, those who are not vaccinated will be protected because the virus won't spread. In the UK, health authorities have expressed alarm at the number of children who have not been vaccinated, with reports up to almost half of children in parts of London have not received both shots. As of September 2023, the Australian government reported immunisation rates across all childhood vaccinations of 93.26% for one-year-olds, 91.22% for two-year-olds, and 94.04% for five-year-olds. There are slight disparities between different states and territories and among some population groups. Boosting vaccination coverage While we appear to be quite close to the herd immunity threshold for measles and not in immediate danger of an outbreak, we still need to be vigilant. Australia has an excellent outbreak surveillance in place in all states for infectious diseases including measles. But outbreaks are occurring globally , and are liable to take hold when people are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. So we need to be alert in all states, increase surveillance at international transit points, and continue to increase immunisation coverage, especially among young children. Educating parents and the wider community about the importance of MMR vaccines is key. It's never too late to be vaccinated against measles if you missed out as a child, or are unsure if you've had two doses. As a single infected traveller can cause an outbreak, vaccination is particularly important if you travel frequently. If you're unsure of your vaccination status, you can ask your GP or check your own or your children's record through the Australian Immunisation Register . If you suspect you or someone in your family is infected it's importa",

        "body": "Financial Stress Could Impact Your Health More Than Grief, Study Finds Health 01 February 2024 By Carly Cassella (Westend61/Getty Images) Financial strain can impact far more than just a person's mental health. A nationally representative study from the United Kingdom has found evidence that stress over money is tied to long-term changes in key health markers, including those associated with the immune system, the nervous system, and the hormonal system. Scientists at University College London (UCL) and Kings College in the UK say that their analysis is the first to explore how different types of chronic stress relate to markers of health in older cohorts. The data for the study included nearly 5,000 adults over the age of 50. Of all six common stressors examined in this cohort \u2013 including financial strain, caregiving, disability, bereavement, illness, and divorce \u2013 financial strain was associated with the riskiest health profiles in the long run. These risk profiles were established using four biomarkers in the blood: cortisol, which is a hormone produced in response to stress, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, which are immune players that respond to inflammation, and insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is linked to aging and longevity. Participants in the study who reported being generally stressed were 61 percent more likely to belong to the high-risk category than the moderate- or low-risk categories at a four-year follow-up. People who were stressed by finances alone, however, were nearly 60 percent more likely to show a high-risk profile four years later. For every added stress, like divorce, that likelihood jumped by 19 percent. These associations remained significant irrespective of genetics, socioeconomics, age, sex, or lifestyle factors. \"We found that financial stress was most detrimental to biological health, although more research is needed to establish this for certain,\" says epidemiologist Odessa Hamilton from UCL. \"This may be because this form of stress can invade many aspects of our lives, leading to family conflict, social exclusion, and even hunger or homelessness.\" The results don't necessarily mean that stress is directly causing long-term health issues, but it does suggest that stress has a significant impact on the aging body, and some forms of stress might have greater physical effects than others. Acute stress is known to trigger a cascade of hormonal changes in the body, which increase breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate. The immune system also responds by producing more pro-inflammatory molecules. This is why staying in an elevated state of stress can lead to chronic immune activation , which could exacerbate physical and mental sicknesses. \"When the immune and neuroendocrine systems function well together, homeostasis is maintained and health is preserved,\" explains Hamilton. \"But chronic stress can disrupt this biological exchange and lead to disease.\" In the current study, financial stress, bereavement, and longstanding illness showed the greatest long-term changes in immune and neuroendocrine biomarkers. This indicates an ongoing physical effect of chronic stress. Of course, four biomarkers are limited in what they can actually tell us about human health. In the current study, for instance, higher alcohol consumption (more than three drinks a week), was associated with a lower risk profile. This may be due to the fact that alcohol has anti-inflammatory effects, but it doesn't necessarily mean increasing your drinking is beneficial for human health overall. The vast majority of participants included in the current analysis were White, which also limits what can be said of the associations, especially as ethnic groups tend to experience higher levels of stress overall. Nevertheless, researchers at UCL conclude that \"the synergistic immune and neuroendocrine response to stress represents an important target for clinical intervention. Intervening on these processes could alter the course of disease.\" The study was published in Brain, Behavior and Immunity .",

        "body": "We Finally Know How Ancient Roman Concrete Was Able to Last Thousands of Years Physics 01 February 2024 By Michelle Starr The dome of the Pantheon. (Ed Freeman/Stone/Getty Images) The ancient Romans were masters of building and engineering, perhaps most famously represented by the aqueducts. And those still functional marvels rely on a unique construction material: pozzolanic concrete, a spectacularly durable concrete that gave Roman structures their incredible strength. Even today, one of their structures \u2013 the Pantheon, still intact and nearly 2,000 years old \u2013 holds the record for the world's largest dome of unreinforced concrete. The properties of this concrete have generally been attributed to its ingredients: pozzolana, a mix of volcanic ash \u2013 named after the Italian city of Pozzuoli, where a significant deposit of it can be found \u2013 and lime . When mixed with water, the two materials can react to produce strong concrete. But that, as it turns out, is not the whole story. In 2023, an international team of researchers led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that not only are the materials slightly different from what we may have thought, but the techniques used to mix them were also different. The smoking guns were small, white chunks of lime that can be found in what seems to be otherwise well-mixed concrete. The presence of these chunks had previously been attributed to poor mixing or materials, but that did not make sense to materials scientist Admir Masic of MIT. \"The idea that the presence of these lime clasts was simply attributed to low quality control always bothered me,\" Masic said back in January 2023. \"If the Romans put so much effort into making an outstanding construction material, following all of the detailed recipes that had been optimized over the course of many centuries, why would they put so little effort into ensuring the production of a well-mixed final product? There has to be more to this story.\" Masic and the team, led by MIT civil engineer Linda Seymour, carefully studied 2,000-year-old samples of Roman concrete from the archaeological site of Privernum in Italy. These samples were subjected to large-area scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and confocal Raman imaging to gain a better understanding of the lime clasts. One of the questions in mind was the nature of the lime used. The standard understanding of pozzolanic concrete is that it uses slaked lime . First, limestone is heated at high temperatures to produce a highly reactive caustic powder called quicklime , or calcium oxide. Mixing quicklime with water produces slaked lime, or calcium hydroxide: a slightly less reactive, less caustic paste. According to theory, it was this slaked lime that ancient Romans mixed with the pozzolana. Based on the team's analysis, the lime clasts in their samples are not consistent with this method. Rather, Roman concrete was probably made by mixing the quicklime directly with the pozzolana and water at extremely high temperatures, by itself or in addition to slaked lime, a process the team calls \"hot mixing\" that results in the lime clasts. \"The benefits of hot mixing are twofold,\" Masic said . \"First, when the overall concrete is heated to high temperatures, it allows chemistries that are not possible if you only used slaked lime, producing high-temperature-associated compounds that would not otherwise form. Second, this increased temperature significantly reduces curing and setting times since all the reactions are accelerated, allowing for much faster construction.\" And it has another benefit: The lime clasts give the concrete remarkable self-healing abilities. When cracks form in the concrete, they preferentially travel to the lime clasts, which have a higher surface area than other particles in the matrix. When water gets into the crack, it reacts with the lime to form a solution rich in calcium that dries and hardens as calcium carbonate, gluing the crack back together and preventing it from spreading further. This has been observed in concrete from another 2,000-year-old site, the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, where cracks in the concrete have been filled with calcite. It could also explain why Roman concrete from seawalls built 2,000 years ago has survived intact for millennia despite the ocean's constant battering. So, the team tested their findings by making pozzolanic concrete from ancient and modern recipes using quicklime. They also made a control concrete without quicklime and performed crack tests. Sure enough, the cracked quicklime concrete was fully healed within two weeks, but the control concrete stayed cracked. The team is now working on commercializing their concrete as a more environmentally friendly alternative to current concretes. \"It's exciting to think about how these more durable concrete formulations could expand not only the service life of these materials, but also how it could impro",

The US Food and Drug Administration awarded accelerated approval to Aduhelm in June 2021 , a decision that was highly contentious at the time because the agency overruled its own independent advisors, who found there was insufficient evidence of benefit. At least three of the 11-member independent committee that voted unanimously against recommending the drug subsequently resigned, and US congressional investigators slammed the accelerated approval as \"rife with irregularities.\" Biogen said it was discontinuing Aduhelm to put more resources into Leqembi, a newer Alzheimer's medicine that was fully approved last year under the traditional regulatory pathway. \"When searching for new medicines, one breakthrough can be the foundation that triggers future medicines to be developed,\" said Christopher Viehbacher, president and CEO of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech firm. \"Aduhelm was that groundbreaking discovery that paved the way for a new class of drugs and reinvigorated investments in the field.\" Aduhelm, a monoclonal antibody that targets the build-up of a protein called amyloid beta in the brain tissue which is thought to be a cause of Alzheimer's, was tested in two late-stage human trials. It showed a reduction in cognitive decline in one of the studies, but not the other. According to a congressional report from December 2022, the FDA \"considered Aduhelm under the traditional approval pathway used for most drugs for nine months, before abruptly changing course and granting approval under the accelerated approval pathway after a three-week review period.\" The report said that FDA interactions with Biogen were \"atypical\" and included a failure to properly document contacts between agency staff and the drug maker. The FDA and Biogen had also \"inappropriately collaborated\" on a joint briefing document for a key advisory committee, it said. \"FDA's approval process was rife with irregularities.\" As for Biogen, the report said the company \"viewed Aduhelm as an unprecedented financial opportunity \u2013 estimating a potential peak revenue of $18 billion per year.\" The congressional panel pointed to an \"unjustifiably high price\" for Aduhelm of $56,000 a year for patients. Biogen's Leqembi, which it co-manufactures with Eisai of Japan, is now the only US-approved treatment for Alzheimer's . It also targets amyloid beta and has been found to modestly reduce cognitive decline in patients with early-stage disease. Donanemab, developed by Eli Lilly, could be next to get the green light after performing similarly in clinical trials . Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia.

A team led by researchers from the University of Exeter in the UK analyzed data on 1,107 people over the age of 40 without a dementia diagnosis, mapping cognitive ability against self-reported musical ability, whether or not they played a musical instrument or sang in a choir, and their music listening habits. The analysis showed \"significantly better performance\" in working memory and executive function from those who played a musical instrument, as well as associations between singing and executive function, and overall musical ability and working memory. There was no equivalent improvement based on music listening habits. \"A number of studies have looked at the effect of music on brain health,\" says Anne Corbett, a cognitive psychologist from the University of Exeter. \"Overall, we think that being musical could be a way of harnessing the brain's agility and resilience, known as cognitive reserve.\" This idea of cognitive reserve is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 a buffer against the effects of aging. The thinking is that people with a larger cognitive reserve, in part built up through lifestyle choices and activities, are less susceptible to diseases such as Alzheimer's . Despite the strong links shown here, they don't prove cause and effect; other factors may be at play too. Those with a higher income might be able to afford both music lessons and a better quality diet , for example, and it could be the diet that is driving improved brain performance. However, it makes sense that playing an instrument would help to keep the brain well exercised, and it's an association that has been spotted in several previous studies too \u2013 adding to the likelihood that there's something going on here. \"Although more research is needed to investigate this relationship, our findings indicate that promoting musical education would be a valuable part of public health initiatives to promote a protective lifestyle for brain health, as would encouraging older adults to return to music in later life,\" says Corbett. If you're thinking of learning to play an instrument \u2013 or perhaps going back to one \u2013 the cognitive boost was highest when it came to the keyboard, with those who tinkled the ivories generally showing far better performance in all three working memory tasks. Across all instruments, continuing to play in later life led to increased benefits. One of the individuals the researchers contacted was 78-year-old Stuart Douglas from Cornwall in the UK, who plays the accordion in a band. He backed up the idea that regularly playing an instrument can keep the mind sharp in later life. \"We regularly play at memory cafes so have seen the effect that our music has on people with memory loss, and as older musicians ourselves we have no doubt that continuing with music into older age has played an important role in keeping our brains healthy,\" says Douglas.

(Andreashorn/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons) A landmark study has identified specific patterns of connections across the brain associated with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), highlighting the importace of considering diverse neurological functions in understanding the nature of the condition. While the study is far from unique in its attempts to identify physical characteristics of ADHD in the brain's wiring, its method does aim to improve on past efforts. US researchers developed a new technique that provides a broad view of the brain to analyze brain scans from around 6,000 children, addressing some limitations in past research. \"Neuroimaging studies of ADHD have been hindered by small sample sizes, small effects, and differences among study methods,\" write bioinformatician Michael Mooney from Oregon Health & Science University and colleagues in their published paper. Using what's known as a polyneuro risk score (PNRS) to combine small differences into brain-wide connectivity patterns, the researchers could predict ADHD symptoms in two independent cohorts. The findings could help future research into the disorder, as well as indicate a new way to study brain imaging in other neurological conditions. ADHD is a complex neurological disorder that affects millions of children and adults . Its diagnosis is based largely on behavior , usually presenting externally as difficulties with attention, impulsivity, and sometimes hyperactivity. Early diagnosis of ADHD can have a significant beneficial impact on the lives of patients and their families. One study found those who don't get diagnosed until adulthood are four times more likely to die early than the general population. The disorder is often stigmatized , sometimes attributed to laziness or a lack of self-control. However, studies suggest ADHD stems from differences in how the brain functions on a structural level. The precise nature and extent of these structural differences is unclear, possibly because effects in specific parts of the brain are small, making the identification of individual neurological features a challenge. ADHD manifests differently in different people , which could be related to how different functional brain systems interact. This connectivity between functional networks can be measured via changes in blood flow in the brain while it's not focused on a task \u2013 resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). A 2014 review of rs-fcMRI research on ADHD revealed some consistency in findings concerning the brain's default mode network. Recent meta-analysis indicated that connectivity in multiple brain networks is associated with ADHD; however most studies haven't looked at brain-wide effects. \"Given considerable evidence that ADHD is associated with alterations in widely distributed brain networks, and the small effects of individual brain features, a whole-brain perspective focusing on cumulative effects is warranted,\" the team writes . The researchers constructed and validated a PNRS to represent the cumulative, total effect of brain-wide measurements of resting state functional connectivity linked to ADHD symptoms. They used data from rs-fcMRI scans and ADHD symptom scores of 5,543 participants; children aged 9-10 years when they enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study , a long-term US study of brain development into adulthood. The link between PNRS and ADHD symptoms was then further tested with 553 participants from the Oregon ADHD-1000 cohort , an independent dataset of people aged 7 to 11 at baseline who have annual follow up tests into adulthood. The 'ADHD PRNS' was significantly associated with ADHD symptoms across both groups. In the Oregon group, people with an ADHD PRNS in the highest 10 percent were 3.86 times more likely to have diagnosed ADHD than those below the median. When analysis was repeated for those with a second scan taken 1.83 years later, the strength of the link between PRNS and ADHD was almost exactly the same. The most significant associations with ADHD were spread across multiple brain networks. The strongest effects were associated with regions that are most active when the brain is at rest, known as the default mode network ; and a structure called the cingulo-opercular network, which includes areas involved in cognitive control, attention, and task monitoring. Previous research indicates dysregulation of these networks contributes to ADHD. The PNRS didn't match polygenic risk scores, which indicate a person's genetic likelihood to have ADHD, suggesting environmental influences also contribute. Mooney and team conclude that more research is still needed to determine how genes, environment, and brain connections all interact to cause ADHD. That said, PNRS could be a useful predictor of ADHD, and potentially reveal connections with other conditions like depression . By combining it with other factors, we might gain valuable insights into neurological behavioral disorders. \"The findings highlight the promise of approaches examining cumulative, brain-wide effects, and the importance of using large samples for improving reproducibility of neuroimaging studies,\" the authors write . The study has been published in The Journal of Neuroscience .",

        "body": "Tomato Juice Can Kill Salmonella, The Bacteria That Terrorizes Our Guts Health 31 January 2024 By Clare Watson (Yagi Studio/Getty Images) Tomatoes could help fight off bacterial infections in your gut, a new study has found. One of the world's most widely consumed vegetables ( or perhaps fruit? ), they are packed with antioxidants, vitamins , and other compounds \u2013 two of which scientists at Cornell University in the US have identified for their potent bacteria-killing properties in a series of cell experiments. The research team, led by Cornell microbiologist Jeongmin Song, was interested in Salmonella , a genus of enteric bacteria that invade the intestine, often causing food poisoning . Specifically, the team focused on one typhoidal serotype of Salmonella , Salmonella enterica Typhi, which lives only in humans and causes typhoid fever when it slips into the bloodstream from the gut and spreads through the body. Like other foodborne pathogens, proper food handling and storage along with access to antibiotics can help people avoid food poisoning from Salmonella . However, typhoid fever remains a big public health problem in many parts of the world where people don't have access to clean water, sanitation, or typhoid vaccines. It spreads person-to-person via contaminated food and water, and children are at highest risk. In 2016, the world's first outbreak of extensively drug-resistant typhoid swept across Pakistan , and eight years later, infectious disease experts still fear it could seed regional or global outbreaks if not controlled. Malnutrition is also common in Pakistan, and other countries throughout Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. A 2023 study of 64 countries found that almost half of children under 2 years didn't consume any fruits or vegetables in their diet. \"Our main goal in this study was to find out if tomato and tomato juice can kill enteric pathogens, including Salmonella Typhi, and if so, what qualities they have that make them work,\" explains Song. Lab-grown cultures of Salmonella Typhi exposed to freshly pulped tomato juice were killed off within 24 hours, and not because of the juice's acidity. The researchers scanned the genome of tomatoes ( Solanum lycopersicum ) looking for genes encoding small proteins called peptides that might act as antimicrobial agents. From four initial candidates, the team identified two antimicrobial peptides that inhibited the growth of Salmonella Typhi and even killed off a strain resistant to ciprofloxacin, the primary antibiotic used to treat typhoid fever. Lastly, the researchers modeled the shape of their two lead candidate peptides and simulated their interactions with the bacterial cell membranes. As the modeling predicted, the two peptides ruptured Salmonella Typhi's cell membranes in just 45 minutes. In further experiments, the compounds also killed Salmonella Typhimurium, a strain of non-typhoidal Salmonella that causes non-lethal food poisoning. Bearing in mind these are just cell experiments, the study findings aren't a reason to go guzzling tomato juice by the gallon; no one type of food is going to work its magic alone. Rather, the study underscores public health messaging that encourages people to eat tomatoes as part of a balanced diet that includes lots of other fruits and vegetables \u2013 provided they are prepared with good food hygiene methods , it might help ward off illness and food poisoning. But that depends on affordability and access . The study has been published in Microbiology Spectrum .",

        "body": "Revealed: HIV's Trick For Invading The Nucleus of a Host's Cell Health 02 February 2024 By David Nield Simulations revealed how HIV penetrated the cell. (Hudait and Voth, PNAS, 2024) Scientists have made an important discovery in understanding how the Human Immunodeficiency Virus \u2013 better known as HIV \u2013 breaks into the nucleus of a cell, enabling it to replicate and spread. This process has been something of a mystery until now, and the research team from the University of Chicago says that their findings will help in understanding HIV and its impact on the body. Ultimately, it could lead to better treatments . To find out exactly how HIV invades a cell nucleus, simulations featuring thousands of proteins were run, looking at the HIV capsid (the capsule containing the virus material) and the cell's nuclear pore complex ; the mailbox-slot through which genetic information is sent and delivered. Numerous simulations were run to test cell interactions. The aqua pill-shaped object is a model of the HIV capsid, and the red and black objects are components of the nuclear pore complex. (Hudait and Voth, PNAS , 2024) \"The pore complex is an incredible piece of machinery,\" says theoretical chemist Gregory Voth from the University of Chicago. \"It can't let just anything into the nucleus of your cell, or you'd be in real trouble, but it's got to let quite a bit of stuff in. Somehow, the HIV capsid has figured out how to sneak in.\" \"The problem is, we can't watch it live: you have to go to heroic experimental efforts to even get a single, moment-in-time snapshot.\" The simulations revealed that the HIV capsid wedges itself in, smallest end first, before applying what's known as an electrostatic ratchet . The researchers compare it to a seatbelt in a car, getting tighter and tighter. Another key finding was that the flexibility and deformation of both the capsid and the pore are crucial in allowing the capsid through. The capsid develops regions of less ordered molecules in order to accommodate the extra pressure, and the researchers think this might explain their cone-like shape. Previously, researchers weren't certain whether the capsid stayed fully intact as it squeezed through the pore complex. Having a better insight into what's happening here will help in the study of cell interactions more generally. \"I think this modeling also gives us a new way to understand how many things get into the nucleus, not just HIV,\" says Voth. This is just one of several steps in the infection process, though is essential to the way HIV infection sustains itself in its host's body. Being able to stop that would be a significant step forward in finding a full cure for the virus . Any treatment that somehow interrupts this sneaky ratcheting method would harm HIV's chances of survival , and the researchers suggest there are potentially a number of ways to go about it. \"For example, you could try to make the HIV capsid less elastic, which our data suggests would hamper its ability to get inside the nucleus,\" says chemist Arpa Hudait, from the University of Chicago. The research has been published in PNAS .",

Kaulig Racingwill be SVG's in both his Xfinity and Cup starts this year as the three-time Supercars champ aims to quickly advance through the world of stock car racing. He is under contract atTrackhouse Racing, which has formed an alliance with Kaulig. SVG won in his Cup debut in spectacular fashion last year, taking victory at the Chicago Street Course for Trackhouse. It was already announced that he would run the full NASCAR Xfinity Series schedule with Kaulig, as well as seven Cup races, but the team for those Cup starts was not specified. On Thursday, Kaulig confirmed that those starts will come in the team's No. 16 car, which will also feature A.J. Allmendinger and Josh Williams throughout the 2024 season. As previously announced, the New Zealander will compete at COTA, the Coke 600, Chicago, Watkins Glen, the Las Vegas playoff race and both Talladega races. \u201cWhen I first started talking with Trackhouse about moving to the U.S., we had no idea how many races we could secure but I knew I wanted to be with that team and organization,\u201d said van Gisbergen in a release from the team. \u201cThere has been a lot of hard work to get to this point and I could not be happier to know that I get to race for an Xfinity Series championship and then get a proper go at the Cup Series on road courses and ovals. Kaulig is a proven winner in both the Xfinity and the Cup Series, and I know with the alliance with Trackhouse, this will be an incredible first year for me in NASCAR.\u201d Kaulig Racing has two Cup victories, both courtesy of Allmendinger, and both coming at road courses [Indianapolis RC - 2021 and Charlotte Roval - 2023]. \"I\u2019m excited to work with Trackhouse and have Shane join our Cup program this season,\u201d said Chris Rice, President of Kaulig Racing. \u201cWhen we locked in SVG for the Xfinity Series, it just became a natural next step on the Cup side since we have all the existing infrastructure and a relationship with the pit crews. Remember, SVG had to pass our car to win the Chicago race. We finished second. So, now we get to race with him which is kind of awesome.\u201d Added Trackhouse founderJustin Marks: \u201cShane is one of the best talents I\u2019ve ever seen. We know he will be competitive on the road courses, so we needed to challenge him and ourselves on oval tracks against Cup Series drivers. This is a big freshman season for Shane, and I really appreciate Matt Kaulig and Chris Rice for helping us bring this to life.\u201d The ties between Trackhouse and Kaulig go beyond SVG. For example, a recent crew chief change atop the pit box forDaniel Suarezsaw them swap personnel with Kaulig. Travis Mack went from Suarez's crew chief to Kaulig as the technical director of its Cup operations and the crew chief for the No. 16 Chevrolet Camaro.

        "body": "Ferrari has confirmed that Lewis Hamilton will join its Formula 1 team in 2025, after the seven-time world champion splits from Mercedes at the end of the 2024. Last summer Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension atMercedescovering the 2024 and 2025 seasons, but he will now joinFerrarione season into that deal, partneringCharles Leclercat the Scuderia from next year. Hamilton's move means Leclerc's current partnerCarlos Sainzwill drive elsewhere in 2025 after the expiry of his current terms, with Leclerc recently committing to a long-term deal at Maranello. Ferrari confirmed the move with a short statement following Mercedes's. \"Scuderia Ferrari is pleased to announce thatLewis Hamiltonwill be joining the team in 2025, on a multi-year contract,\" it said. The news is set to bring an end to what will be a 12-year stay for Hamilton at Mercedes, having joined Brackley in 2013 in a similarly spectacular move fromMcLaren, the team with which he made his debut in 2007 and won his first world title the following year. That move proved a huge success, with Mercedes becoming the dominant force at the dawn of the turbo hybrid era in 2014. The team propelled Hamilton to six further world titles in seven years, only losing out to team-mateNico Rosbergin 2016. Hamilton amassed 82 of his 103 wins and 78 of his 104 poles for the squad, etching his status as the most successful driver of all time. Hamilton's throne was ultimately usurped byMax Verstappenin a controversial 2021 title showdown, and subsequently, Mercedes lost its top spot to Red Bull, with Hamilton winless since the 2022-era regulations came into force. Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes-AMG Photo by: Steve Etherington /Motorsport Images Aged 39, Hamilton has now opted for a late change of scenery in the autumn of his career, and a reunion with Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur, who was the Briton's team boss at ART in GP2. As Ferrari re-signed Leclerc for 2025 and beyond, contract talks with Sainz were not progressing as swiftly, with Hamilton's availability now emerging as the underlying reason. His arrival is now set to bring Sainz's four-year spell in Maranello to an end, having taken his first two grand prix wins with the squad. The 29-year-old also claimed five poles and 16 further podiums for the team after earlier stints at McLaren, Renault and Toro Rosso. Shortly after the announcement of Hamilton's move, Sainz issued a response confirming his Ferrari exit. Carlos Sainz, Scuderia Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes-AMG, talk after the race Photo by: Sam Bloxham /Motorsport Images \"Following today's news, Scuderia Ferrari and myself will part ways at the end of 2024,\" Sainz wrote on his social media channels. \"We still have a long season ahead of us and, like always, I will give my absolute best for the team and for the tifosi all around the world. \"News about my future will be announced in due course.\" Hamilton's surprise departure for pastures new leaves a hole in Mercedes' driver line-up for 2025 alongsideGeorge Russell, just as the likes of Leclerc and McLaren'sLando Norrishave been taken off the board by their respective teams. As well as a straight swap with Sainz, Williams'Alex Albonand Alpine'sEsteban Oconcould be among the options Mercedes will weigh up in the coming weeks and months.",

Off the back of a positive statement regarding its revenue and core earnings, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amorization) anticipated to grow to $2.64 billion this year on a healthy orderbook, there was a notable step change in its price. Having closed Wednesday\u2019s trading with a share price of $346.78, after the opening on Thursday it rocketed to a high of $384.00 soon after, and is anticipated to go even higher over the course of the day.This gives Ferrari an estimated market capitalisation of $69.12 billion \u2013 which is well up on the $62.4 billion that it was worth at close of trading on Wednesday. The almost $7 billion increase in company value is a huge vote of confidence in Ferrari\u2019s decision to pursue Hamilton, and marks a high point in the Italian sportscar manufacturer\u2019s price on the NYSE.Ferrari\u2019s current stock price is well up on its 12 month low of $252.17Last year Hamilton signed a long-term contract with Mercedes that covered the 2024 and 2025 campaigns, but it now appears that the second season was only an option.It is understood that Hamilton has activated an exit clause that will allow him to join Ferrari in 2025 as replacement forCarlos Sainz, whose current contract comes to an end this year.",

After contesting the last two seasons with Tanner Foust and Emma Gilmour as its two drivers, McLaren revealed in December that the duo would depart the team after achieving a best finish of second - in the 2022 Energy X-Prix in Uruguay and in Scotland's Hydro X-Prix last season. Ekstrom, who raced for the Acciona Sanz team last year as a replacement for Carlos Sainz Sr following his back injury sustained on the Dakar Rally and Gutierrez, the 2022 XE champion with Lewis Hamilton's X44 team, will form an all-new line-up as XE prepares to bow out in its current guise at the end of the season.

Joining McLaren brings together two-time DTM champion Ekstrom and his old rival from the German tin-top series Gary Paffett, who is sporting director of McLaren's XE operation.

        "body": "Mercedes has expanded its GT racing roster to 19 factory drivers in 2024 after adding several newcomers to the programme. Although it hasn\u2019t signed a like-for-like replacement for its previous star Raffaele Marciello, who has switched to rival brand BMW, multiple new names will campaign the Mercedes-AMG GT3 in factory capacity across a wide variety of championships this year. Supercars star David Reynolds is the most notable name to step up to the factory roster, having made several appearances in Bathurst 12 Hour and GT World Challenge Australia at the wheel of the AMG GT3 over the last few years. Former Brazilian Stock Car championFelipe Fragais another driver to have been awarded factory status by Mercedes based on his results with the marque. Although best known for his race-winning campaigns in the World Endurance Championship and DTM with Aston Martin and Ferrari respectively, Fraga has racked up over 30 endurance outings in Mercedes machinery since 2018. A complete newcomer to Mercedes\u2019 line-up is Frank Bird, who impressed the German manufacturer during the AMG Young Driver test at Valencia last November and again in the Gulf 12 Hours in December. Most of Mercedes\u2019 top-line drivers will stay in the programme for another season, with the exception of Marciello. The list includesLucas Auer,Luca Stolz,Maro Engel, Maximilian Gotz and Jules Gounon, all of whom are designated as \u2018Performance Drivers\u2019 along with Adam Christodoulou,Philip Ellis,Mikael Grenier,Arjun Mainiand Fabian Schiller. EvenDaniel Juncadellawill remain in the Mercedes fold despite signing a deal with Corvette to represent the General Motors brand in WEC and the enduro rounds of the IMSA SportsCar Championship. However, the Spaniard will have a reduced role at the German brand and is now classified as an \u2018Expert Driver\u2019. Mercedes also confirmed thatDavid Schumacherwill remain with the marque despite another frustrating season in the DTM that yielded just a single finish inside the top 10. He will be one of the four Junior drivers along with newcomer Bird, 2023 recruit Ralf Aron and promising young talentJusuf Owega. Maini, who was previously classified as a Junior, has been promoted to Performance status.

Mercedes is expected to announce the exact programmes for each of the 19 drivers in due course. \u201cI am delighted that we are able to present a competitive driver line-up in 2024 once again,\u201d said Stefan Wendl, Head of Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing. \u201cBuilding on the experience recently accumulated, we have a well-balanced mix of champions and endurance race winners as well as young, talented drivers who are eager to win. \u201cI am particularly happy about Frank Bird, a promising Junior has presented and qualified himself through the AMG Young Driver Test. Together, we want to rack up wins for AMG in the most significant endurance races and championships again this year.\u201d Performance riders:Lucas Auer (AUT), Philip Ellis (SUI), Maro Engel (GER),Maximilian Gotz(GER), Jules Gounon (AND), Mikael Grenier (CAN), Arjun Maini (IND), Fabian Schiller (GER ), Luca Stolz (GER) Junior riders: Ralf Aron (EST), Bird Frank (GBR) Jordan Love (AUS), Jusuf Owega (GER), David Schumacher (GER) Expert drivers:Adam Christodoulu (GBR), Felipe Fraga (BRA), Daniel Juncadella (ESP), Daniel Morad (CAN), David Reynolds (AUS) Test and development driver:Thomas Jager (GER)",

        "body": "McLaren says that the ever-present \u201cthreat\u201d of getting knocked out by backmarkers in qualifying is proof that Formula 1\u2019s cost cap is working. Grand Prix teams have operated under budget cap regulations since the start of the 2021 season, with F1 chiefs having introduced the rules in a bid to stop the kind of spending war that risked the grid's long-term sustainability. And while it has been a challenge for the top spenders to stay under the limit, with Red Bull famously having broken the cap in 2021, there is a consensus that it has properly levelled the playing field. McLarenCEO Zak Brown says that there is no better proof of the impact it is having than the fact that the front to the back of the grid has closed up so much \u2013 which can make life more difficult for his outfit. \"I think the cap has been outstanding for the sport,\" explained Brown. \"It's not yet perfect but I don't think that something that is so young wasn't going to have some loopholes which the FIA are closing \u2013 such as TD45 [which prevents IP from side projects being used by F1 teams]. \"Max [Verstappen] made it the most dominant season by one driver and team ever, but if you took Max out of the equation, you had for the first time five teams with seven or more podiums. \"I can't recall a team that has been 10th in the constructors' [championship], always being a threat to be in Q3. I think we're all used to the team being in P10 being three seconds off pole. \"I think the budget cap has had the intended consequences of making the field much more competitive. \"I can tell you from sitting on the pit wall, there's no team that we don't think \u2013 when we're looking at times \u2013 is a threat to get into Q3. That's the benefit of the budget cap.\" Photo by: Steven Tee /Motorsport Images Oscar Piastri, McLaren MCL60 leading Nyck de Vries, AlphaTauri AT04 and Logan Sargeant, Williams FW45, at the Austrian Grand Prix Brown's comments about the closeness of the field were proven last year when F1 experienced a fight for grid spots that was perhaps closer than ever. In the F1 season finale in Abu Dhabi, the entire grid was covered by just 0.999 seconds in the Q1 fight, with the cut-off point being just 0.440 seconds off the top spot. These figures are a marked contrast from the start of the ground-effect era when the grid at the 2022 Bahrain GP was covered by 2.163 seconds, with the cut-off being 1.255 seconds. Brown's theory about the bottom teams also being challengers for Q3 were confirmed when the Haas team would regularly get itself involved in the fight for the top grid spots. Nico Hulkenbergmade frequent appearances in Q3, whileKevin Magnussendelivered the team's best qualifying slot of the season when he secured fourth on the grid in Miami. Mercedestechnical director James Allison said recently that he reckoned the closer grid was also being caused by the current technical rules set limiting the amount of progress that can be made with the ground-effect cars. \"I think if you look at last year, you see from the start of the season to the end of the season, although Red Bull's dominance was near complete and they didn't look vulnerable even to the last race of the year if you look at the bigger picture, this is a grid that is gradually compressing,\" he said. \"All the cars in Q1 would sort of squash down within one second of each other, and that's not a coincidence. \"It's a trend that has happened from 2022, continued in 2023 and I think will continue to show itself in 2024 because the gains are getting more and more asymptotic.\"",

Tanak and team-matesThierry NeuvilleandAndreas Mikkelsenall suffered from a throttle mapping issues on their i20 Ns during the first two stages of the Monte Carlo Rally last Thursday. While the problem was quickly rectified for Neuville and Mikkelsen, Tanak continued to struggle with the anti-lag system on his i20 N throughout the remainder of the rally. Tanak was still able to bring the i20 N home in fourth but was 1m59.8s behind eventual winner Neuville. Hyundai team principal Cyril Abiteboul admitted he was concerned by the engine dramas his team suffered in Monte Carlo, but also believed Tanak's driving style contributed to the 2019 world champion's struggles in adapting to the i20 N. Abiteboul said the team will work on delivering a car much more tailored to Tanak's style for the next round of the championship in Sweden from 15-18 February. \"Of course, I am concerned by the engine issues because it means that we need to improve our validation process because this should not happen at this level of championship,\" Abiteboul told Motorsport.com.

        "date": "2024-02-01 10:10:29",
        "body": "Lewis Hamilton is on the cusp of a sensational move to Ferrari for 2025 to replace Carlos Sainz, despite having agreed a contract extension last year to provisionally keep him at the Mercedes Formula 1 team. Hamilton has been linked with a Maranello move on several occasions and speculation seemed to surface each time the driver was in the midst of negotiation a new deal withMercedes. As such, those rumours might have been a handy means of improving the Hamilton camp\u2019s bartering position since there was rarely anything more concrete than dinner withFerraripresident John Elkann. The whispers of Hamilton joining the Scuderia this time around seem more credible, however, given the timing. Ferrari has recently agreed a contract extension for talismanic driverCharles Leclercfor \u201cseveral more seasons\u201d. And, it would appear that Hamilton has the paperwork in place to remain at Mercedes for the 2024 and 2025 seasons following his latest extension. But what was initially thought to be a two-year deal could instead be a one-plus-one arrangement with exit clauses at the end of the first term. In this case, the end of the coming season. Having the provisions to exit early would not necessarily guarantee a Ferrari switch. It would give Hamilton the option to retire earlier than planned or at least the possibility of extricating himself from Mercedes. While Hamilton has driven for the Silver Arrows since 2013 and the two parties have won six drivers\u2019 and eight constructors\u2019 title together, the ground-effects rules overhaul of 2022 caused the team to stumble. In a bid to recapture its former glory and chase after Red Bull, chief technical officer James Allison has returned to a hands-on role by once again taking up the position of technical director. He has also signed a new contract in recent weeks. Photo by: Sam Bloxham /Motorsport Images Carlos Sainz, Scuderia Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes-AMG, talk after the race But given Mercedes adapted poorly to the new rules with its \u2018size-zero\u2019 sidepod architecture and then persevered with the concept again in 2023, the W15 challenger that will break cover this month marks a major design reset. If the new direction does not bring about a major boost to the team\u2019s competitive fortunes, it reduces the risks for Hamilton should he want to break away. With Hamilton not long having celebrated his 39th birthday, time is running out should he want to fulfil an F1 driver dream by moving to Ferrari \u2013 even if the Italian squad is not necessarily any better placed to deliver him a record-setting eight world crown. Should he accept that Red Bull is too far ahead to be caught by any rival in the immediate future, then the emotional pull of the Prancing Horse might alone be enough of a reason to move. Certainly, Elkann has never hid his admiration for Hamilton. And pulling off that signing would mark a major coup for him and Ferrari and boost its appeal, which would in turn assist team boss Fred Vasseur in his ongoing recruitment drive to bolster the depleted technical department. Incumbent Ferrari driverCarlos Sainz\u2019s contract situation would also fit with Hamilton switching to Ferrari. The Spaniard\u2019s deal runs out at the end of this season, and he has been clear that, ideally, he wants his future to be decided before the start of the new campaign. That\u2019s a luxury that has now been afforded to Leclerc, but not for Sainz. Talks have dragged on. Sainz \u2013 having stacked up well against Leclerc in their three seasons at team-mates \u2013 was seen to be in a good place to negotiate a higher salary and a preferred two-year deal. The driver wanting these much-improved terms were believed to be behind the delays in a contract announcement. But the alternative is that Ferrari already had its sights set on another sensational option.",

Hamilton has been linked with a Maranello move on several occasions and speculation seemed to surface each time the driver was in the midst of negotiation a new deal with Mercedes.",

Although it is not clear if a final contract has been signed, Motorsport.com understands that negotiations are at an advanced stage and could be concluded by the end of this week. Ferrari has long been interested in Hamilton\u2019s services but its overtures have previously been rejected because the seven-time champion felt Mercedes offered him a better route to success. However it now appears that, off the back of two challenging seasons for Mercedes, Ferrari is now close to convincing Hamilton that it is a better bet for the future. Last year Hamilton signed a multi-year contract with Mercedes for 2024 and 2025 but it now appears that the second season may have only been an option. That means Hamilton will have an escape clause that means, if he signs for Ferrari, then he will be able to join from 2025. Both Ferrari and Mercedes have declined to comment on the situation. Photo by: Steve Etherington /Motorsport Images Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes F1 W14, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari SF-23 Should Hamilton\u2019s move be confirmed, it will be a huge blow to Mercedes \u2013 which went through lengthy contract negotiations with him last year to secure his services into this year. Speaking just after the deal was done, Hamilton was at pains to suggest that he had belief that Mercedes had learned the lessons from its challenging 2022/2023 seasons, and could enjoy a chance to return to glory with its all new car for this campaign. Asked by Motorsport.com at last year\u2019s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix if he ever doubted getting back to the front, he said: \u201cNo, not when we were doing negotiations. \u201cI do have faith that we will get there, we have been here before as a team, and while we have more and more new people, we still have a great values, I see great focus within everyone. He added: \u201cI think for this year [2023] they thought the fundamentals were good and we just have to go here and it\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s why I was frustrated in February, because they hadn\u2019t made the changes I\u2019d asked (for). \u201cBut with the changes we are making, I hope I was, I hope we are right and, yeah, but I guess we have no idea what the Red Bulls are going to do.\u201d It is unclear what has been the trigger point for a potential change of heart over Hamilton\u2019s commitment to Mercedes, where he had been expected to see out his F1 career. Early indications from the Mercedes wind tunnel have pointed to the new W15 being a good step forward for the squad, while the German manufacturer recently made clear that team boss Toto Wolff and technical director James Allison had extended their contracts for the long term.",

        "body": "Andretti\u2019s hopes of securing a Formula 1 entry have been dashed for now, after grand prix racing\u2019s commercial rights holder said on Wednesday it had rejected the American squad's bid for 2025. However, in a lengthy statement detailing why FOM did not feel Andretti justified a spot on the grid over the next few years, it was made clear that there was scope for it to grab the 11th slot from 2028. Back in October, the FIA announced that, following an expression of interest request from prospective entrants, it was satisfied that Andretti\u2019s technical capabilities were strong enough for it to justify an entry. However, as part of a new team\u2019s process that is laid down in the Concorde Agreement, Andretti required a commercial deal sorted with F1\u2019s owner Liberty Media before it would be allowed to compete. Getting such a deal across the line was never going to be easy, as F1 had made clear that it was lukewarm to the idea of expanding the grid unless it could be proved that a new entry would deliver a clear benefit. Photo by: Andretti Autosport Wind Tunnel Model in Toyota Cologne Following months of deliberation and discussions with key stakeholders, F1 has concluded that it does not believe opening up the grid to Andretti is the right thing to do. In the statement it said: \u201cOur assessment process has established that the presence of an 11th team would not, on its own, provide value to the championship. The most significant way in which a new entrant would bring value is by being competitive. We do not believe that the applicant would be a competitive participant.\u201d It furthermore added that it felt having an extra team on the grid would put unnecessary financial strain on current race promoters. \"The addition of an 11th team would place an operational burden on race promoters, would subject some of them to significant costs, and would reduce the technical, operational and commercial spaces of the other competitors,\" it added. \"We were not able to identify any material expected positive effect on CRH financial results, as a key indicator of the pure commercial value of the Championship.\" UPDATE:In response to the news, Andretti family patriarch Mario \u2013 the 1978 F1 World Champion \u2013 tweeted: \"I'm devastated. I won't say anything else because I can't find any other words besides devastated.\" Another key element behind F1\u2019s stance is Andretti\u2019s engine situation, with the squad required to take customer power units from 2025 or 2026 \u2013 a deal which may be forced on current manufacturers. F1 felt this was not a good situation for the health of the championship, but its feelings could change once Andretti gets plans for an alliance with Cadillac up and running, potentially as early as 2028. \u201cWe would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 Championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house,\u201d added F1. \u201cIn this case there would be additional factors to consider in respect of the value that the Applicant would bring to the Championship, in particular in respect of bringing a prestigious new OEM to the sport as a PU supplier.\u201d Speaking about the decision-making process last summer, F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali said: \"As we always said, we need to make sure that the decision is right for the business. And this is what I think is the duty of the FIA and us together, that has to be taken.\u201d",

        "date": "2024-01-31 16:39:04",
        "body": "Peugeot will not race its heavily-revised 2024-spec 9X8 Le Mans Hypercar until round two of this year\u2019s World Endurance Championship at Imola in April. A move that had been widely expected has been confirmed by Peugeot Sport technical director Olivier Jansonnie, who has revealed that the French manufacturer will race in the 2024 WEC curtain-raiser at Qatar in March with a car unchanged from the specification in which it contested last year\u2019s season finale in Bahrain. Jansonnie explained that the timing of the decision to undertake a radical overhaul of the avant-garde 9X8 with the swap from equal-size tyres on both axles to narrower fronts and wider rears meant that a debut at Qatar on 2 March had never been an option. \u201cWe knew from the start that we couldn\u2019t make it [the homologation of the revised car] in February,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason is that with this homologation process, when you do a joker, you can\u2019t just do half of the job, you have to do it fully, and that takes time to make sure you maximise the effect of your joker. \u201cWe know that the level of competition was very high last year and will be even higher this year, so it is very important for us to bring something that is making a clear step forward in terms of performance.\u201d Photo by: Peugeot Sport Olivier Jansonnie, Peugeot Sport technical director project 9X8 Peugeot didn\u2019t announce its decision to change from the 31/31 tyre option to the 29/34 run on the Toyota and Ferrari LMHs until last year\u2019s Bahrain WEC finale in November, although it was known to have tested a modified current-spec 9X8 with the new set-up in the summer. The in-house factory Peugeot Sport squad is working towards completing the new homologation by the end of March in order to race the evolution version of the car at Imola on 11 April. \u201cThe timeframe is trying to be ready for racing in Imola,\u201d Jansonnie said. He insisted \u201cthere is no question\u201d of the debut of the revised car being pushed back until round three at Spa in May. Jansonnie added that after initial testing \u201cthe results are matching our expectations\u201d. The revisions to the 2024 version of the 9X8 are substantial, Jansonnie explained. \u201cFirst we needed to move the weight distribution of the car,\u201d he said. \u201cOur car was designed to have a very forward weight distribution to go with the 31/31 tyres, so we have had to move it back by a substantial amount. \u201cWe needed some lighter parts on the car and to move some ballast, and then retune the aero balance. \u201cEverything is driven by the tyre choice we are making now.\u201d Jansonnie wouldn\u2019t confirm that this will include the addition of a conventional rear wing, something that appears to be the case on the evidence of spy shots of the car testing at Paul Ricard before Christmas. Nor would he reveal whether there are any other upgrades on the car under the so-called \u2018evo joker\u2019 rules, which allow for only five changes made in the name of performance over the full lifecycle of the car. It is understood that there is also a significant upgrade to Peugeot\u2019s 2.6-litre twin-turbo V6. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to disclose too many details on what we are doing exactly on the jokers. \u201cWe all have a limited number of jokers, five for the complete homologation, so we are trying to restrict the scope of what we are doing to the essential points for performance.\u201d",

        "date": "2024-01-31 15:43:18",
        "body": "Formula 1 has rejected Andretti Global's bid to enter the championship from 2025, having come to the conclusion that it doesn't meet the criteria to be the 11th team on the grid. Here's the full statement. Application to participate in the FIA Formula One World Championship Summary and conclusions of commercial assessment process January 2024 Introduction 1. On 22 March 2023, the FIA published an invitation (theInvitation) to apply to participate in the FIA Formula One World Championship (theChampionship), to which four applicants responded, among them Andretti Formula Racing, LLC (theApplicant). The FIA conducted an initial assessment process, which included both a written question and response element and an in-person meeting. 2. The FIA announced on 2 October 2023 that they were satisfied that the application submitted by the Applicant (theApplication) fulfilled their selection criteria in all material respects, and that accordingly, the FIA considered that the Applicant should progress to the next stage of the agreed process as set out in the Invitation, being an assessment by the Commercial Rights Holder of the Applicant\u2019s value to the Championship. The process set out in the Invitation provides that both the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder must consider an application suitable in order for a new entrant to be selected. 3. The FIA had previously shared with us the materials submitted by each of the four applicants in response to the Invitation, which we had studied. Following the FIA\u2019s announcement, we wrote to the Applicant on 10 October 2023, setting out the assessment process, and details of the considerations and decision-making process pursuant to which we would conduct our commercial assessment (theProcess Letter). The Process Letter contained a list of questions for the Applicant, to which the Applicant provided responses on 24 October 2023. 4. Having had the opportunity to consider the Applicant\u2019s responses together with our own deliberations, we subsequently wrote to the Applicant on 12 December 2023 extending an invitation to an in-person meeting at our offices in order for the Applicant to present its application, but the Applicant did not take us up on this offer. 5. This document summarises our review process and the key conclusions arising from it. Review process 6. As contemplated by the Process Letter, we took account of the broad range of ways in which value could be provided, including value to fans, the prestige and reputational value of the sport, the competitive balance of the Championship and the sustainability goals of the sport. The key areas of review were: a. consideration of the likely competitiveness of the Applicant\u2019s entry, and its impact on value; b. consideration of the Applicant\u2019s arrangements with respect to the supply of Power Units and the impact that those arrangements would have on the Applicant\u2019s competitive performance; c. research into the potential benefits the Applicant might bring in terms of fan growth, and fan engagement, as well as a review of the equivalent materials prepared by C|T Group on behalf of the Applicant; d. consultation with key stakeholders to understand their view of the value that the Applicant would bring; e. consideration of the operational impact on our existing circuits of adding an 11th team; f. consideration of the likely impact of the Applicant\u2019s entry on the Commercial Rights Holder\u2019s financial results as an indicator of value; and g. consideration of the Applicant\u2019s financial sustainability based on the materials provided. 7. Our assessment did not involve any consultation with the current F1 teams. However, in considering the best interests of the Championship we took account of the impact of the entry of an 11th team on all commercial stakeholders in the Championship. Photo by: Art Fleischmann Cadillac logo General 8. Our assessment process has established that the presence of an 11th team would not, in and of itself, provide value to the Championship. 9. Any 11th team should show that its participation and involvement would bring a benefit to the Championship. The most significant way in which a new entrant would bring value is by being competitive, in particular by competing for podiums and race wins. This would materially increase fan engagement and would also increase the value of the Championship in the eyes of key stakeholders and sources of revenue such as broadcasters and race promoters. 10. The Application contemplates an association with General Motors (GM) that does not initially include a PU supply, with an ambition for a full partnership with GM as a PU supplier in due course, but this will not be the case for some years. Having a GM PU supply attached to the Application at the outset would have enhanced its credibility, though a novice constructor in partnership with a new entrant PU supplier would also have a significant challenge to overcome. Most of the attempts to establish a new constructor in the last sev",

The Ford squad has opted to promote its Rally2 driversAdrien FourmauxandGregoire Munsterto its Rally1 programme for 2024, followingOtt Tanak\u2019s decision to leave the organisation to re-join Hyundai. Fourmaux and Munster impressed across Monte Carlo\u2019s 17 tricky asphalt stages last weekend. Both set a top-three stage time, while Fourmaux produced an impressive drive to bag 11 points, only two shy of his entire season total achieved during his first Rally1 campaign in 2022. The Frenchman finished fifth overall [+3m36.9s] and fifth on Sunday, ahead of factory driversTakamoto Katsuta(Toyota) andAndreas Mikkelsen(Hyundai). Munster was also on course to finish sixth overall before a small error on Saturday left his Ford Puma beached at the side of the road. Munster rejoined the rally on Sunday to claim a solitary point after finishing seventh in the \u2018Super Sunday\u2019 classification. \u201cWe came here with a clear goal of getting both cars to the finish, to gain experience with the drivers and to show that we can be competitive this year,\u201d said Millener. \u201cI firmly believe we achieved all of this. Both crews each scored a third-fastest time and drove sensibly over what was still a tricky Monte Carlo Rally. I am really pleased for both of them, and also the team who, as ever, worked very hard to get us here and gave us two perfectly reliable cars. \u201cI think the big positive is, it goes to show the people that were kind of writing us off at the start that we are still there [fighting at front]. \u201cWe are going to have to pick and choose, we are not going to be competitive on every rally, but we definitely are going to have opportunities for podiums and getting in the way of the championship fight.\u201d Photo by: M-Sport Adrien Fourmaux, Alexandre Coria, M-Sport Ford World Rally Team Ford Puma Rally1 Fourmaux also believes his performance over the rally proved a point, showcasing that he has matured as a driver. \u201cI am really pleased with what we have done. The goal was for fifth and we achieved that. I think we managed the rally well and we are the first crew behind the four top guys. And behind us is Andreas and Takamoto who are really experienced,\u201d Fourmaux told Autosport/Motorsport.com. \u201cThis is what I learnt from last year. Ok we are missing some pace, but it is a work in progress. We are taking 11 points it is more than if we finished fifth last year. It is positive. \u201cSome people had doubts about us fighting at the front. Ok we are not fighting for the win, but we were just behind. We are competitive and I think it will give some support to the fans, so this is good.\u201d Munster added: \u201cThe goal was just to get experience on this tricky rally in Monte-Carlo, and I think we managed to do that. \u201cUnfortunately, we had to retire on Saturday and restart, but I think we grabbed a lot of experience and showed great pace. Thanks to the route note crews and weather crews, we managed to get a third-fastest time, which is our best result so far on a WRC stage. \u201cWe also managed to be within 0.5s/km of Thierry [Neuville] on Saturday morning, while he was the fastest car on the loop, which was a real positive. \u201cWe grabbed our first point in WRC, we could have achieved more without the mistake on Saturday, but still great learning, and thanks to the team the car was working perfectly throughout the weekend.\u201d",

The new Pramac rider enjoyed two days of testing on Monday and Tuesday as part of the private test organised by Ducati for World Superbike teams at the Algarve Circuit near Portimao. In addition to the WSBK riders, a good number of MotoGP runners were present at the Algarve track, most of them from the Ducati orbit with the sporty Panigale V4 road bike. Among them was Morbidelli, reigning world championFrancesco Bagnaia,Marco Bezzecchiand the brothersAlex MarquezandMarc Marquez, who will ride with Gresini in 2024. During the last part of the second session on Tuesday, Morbidelli suffered a very heavy crash at Turn 9. As it was a private event organised by the ArubaDucati team, there were officials and medical personnel on track, but not in the usual numbers found at a grand prix. After the crash, the Marquez brothers just arrived at the scene, where a red flag was displayed, stopped their bikes and helped to evacuate Morbidelli from the track, after an ambulance came to pick him up. In fact, the Pramac team thanked the two Gresini riders for their help on social media. After seeing that the blow was very strong and that the Italian was very shocked, the medical centre of the circuit took the decision to transfer Morbidelli to Faro Hospital, where a CT scan was performed and a small blood clot in the head was discovered. It was decided that the former Yamaha rider would spend the night in the hospital. Photo by: Gold and Goose /Motorsport Images Franco Morbidelli, Yamaha Factory Racing On Wednesday morning, Motorsport.com has learned doctors performed a second CT scan on Morbidelli to check the evolution of the clot. \"It seems that everything is fine, we are waiting for the results of the second CT scan to confirm that he has no problem despite the big blow he received to the head. The impressions are positive but they wanted to make sure,\" reported team sources. For the moment the doctors have not yet discharged Morbidelli, who is expected to remain one more day in Faro. \"We'll see if they let him out of the hospital tonight, but most likely it won't be until tomorrow that he will be able to travel back to Italy,\" they added. If Morbidelli were to travel home on 1 February, he would have four days before he sets off for the Malaysia test on 6-8 February, which means two flights of between six and seven hours each, for which he must receive medical clearance. \"If they let him go home today or tomorrow, we understand that Franco will be able to be at next week's test, but that's something we can't confirm from the team,\" the sources said. Morbidelli joins Pramac from Yamaha and will ride a factory Ducati in 2024 alongside championship runner-upJorge Martin.",

        "body": "The 2024 MotoGP calendar has been revised by series promoter Dorna Sports following the cancellation of the Argentina Grand Prix. This year\u2019s calendar was due to be the longest in history at 22 rounds, beginning on 10 March with the Qatar Grand Prix. However, last week the third round of the season in Argentina looked under serious threat due to government spending cuts under the country\u2019s new president. As first reported by Motorsport.com, the cuts directly affect the race staged at Termas de Rio Hondo as the grand prix is heavily subsidised by the government. On Wednesday 31 January, Dorna and MotoGP\u2019s governing body the FIM confirmed that the Argentina GP has been struck from the 2024 calendar. Argentina returned to the MotoGP calendar in 2014 at the Rio Hondo track and has been a mainstay on the schedule ever since \u2013 barring the two COVID years in 2020 and 2021. The event has faced numerous hurdles over the last few years, first with a massive fire that gutted its pit complex at the start of 2021, and then with freight delays in 2022 that forced the first day of the grand prix to be iced. The press release from the FIM and Dorna confirms that Argentina will not be replaced this year. \"The FIM, IRTA and Dorna Sports confirm the cancellation of the 2024 Argentina GP,\" a statement read. \"Due to the current circumstances in Argentina, the promoter of the event has communicated that it is currently unable to guarantee the services required for the Grand Prix to take place in 2024 at MotoGP standards. \"This event will not be replaced on the 2024 calendar. MotoGP hopes to return to race at Termas de Rio Hondo in 2025.\" Photo by: Gold and Goose /Motorsport Images Start line Argentina had been due to form a back-to-back with the Americas GP in Texas, but now a three-week gap will split the Portuguese GP and the Austin round. At present, there are no other calendar changes. Should the rest of the calendar go ahead, 21 rounds will remain a record for MotoGP, with the addition of the inaugural Kazakhstan GP in June. To be run at the new Sokol circuit, Kazakhstan is scheduled to take place on the weekend of 14-16 June. Should any more rounds drop off the calendar, MotoGP does have a circuit on its reserve list that could be called upon should it meet homologation requirements. The Balaton Park track in Hungary, opened last year, was announced late last year as a reserve venue for the 2024 MotoGP season. MotoGP last visited Hungary in 1992 at the Hungaroring.",

Ganassi has revealed that only for the longer races \u2014 the Qatar 1812km or 10-hour season-opener next month, the Le Mans 24 Hours and then the Bahrain 8 Hours season finale \u2014 does it intend to run a third driver alongsideEarl BamberandAlex Lynn. The news follows comments from the General Motors brand early this month that it would only confirm its full line-up ahead of each of the 2024 WEC races, at the same time as hinting at the two-driver plan. \u201cWe\u2019re only looking for an extra driver for Qatar, Bahrain and, of course, Le Mans,\u201d said team founder Chip Ganassi. \u201cKeep it simple, that\u2019s what we are trying to do.\u201d Asked if the team was aiming for a performance gain by maximising seat time with a two-driver line-up, Ganassi replied: \u201cEverything we do around here is the quicker way, or is trying to be the quicker way. \u201cIt\u2019s racing, that\u2019s what it is all about.\u201d When asked which driver or drivers might fill the seat occupied byRichard Westbrookin 2023 for the longer races, Ganassi said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see some familiar drivers sprinkled in there.\u201d That is clearly a reference to its line-up in the V-Series.R Ganassi fields in the IMSA SportsCar Championship in North America.

Levitt /Motorsport Images #01 Cadillac Chip Ganassi Racing Cadillac V-Series.R: Renger van der Zande, Sebastien Bourdais, Scott Dixon, Alex Palou On the assumption that Ganassi gets its second entry under the Cadillac Racing banner for Le Mans in June, the team would need to bring in an additional driver for double-points WEC round. Asked if the team could call on reigning IndyCar champion Alex Palou at Le Mans, Ganassi said: \u201cWe could.\u201d The Spaniard made his second start for the Ganassi Cadillac squad in last weekend\u2019s Daytona 24 Hours IMSA curtain-raiser and \u201cslipped right back in\u201d, according to Ganassi. The path to the IndyCar regulars on the Cadillac roster racing at Le Mans has been smoothed by a shift of test dates at the Milwaukee oval during the week of the French race. An IndyCar test was originally scheduled for the Wednesday, putting it in direct conflict with the opening day of practice and first qualifying at Le Mans. It has now swapped days with the Indy NXT feeder series and will take place on the Tuesday. That will allow Scott Dixon andTom Blomqvist, who are respectively the endurance drivers for Ganassi and Action Express Racing in IMSA this year, to travel overnight to get to Le Mans in time for the start of practice. That would be particularly pertinent should Ganassi decide to run Palou. He has never competed at Le Mans and would be unable to take part in the official Test Day the Sunday before the race on 15/16 June as the result of a clash with the Road America IndyCar event. Fellow Cadillac team Action Express looks certain to get a spot on the 62-car Le Mans grid after being named as one of the discretionary entries for the race that IMSA is allowed to name.",

The statement said, in part, \u201cContrary to media reports, Brodie Kostecki remains part of the Erebus Motorsport family and is a valued member of our team. \u201cBrodie has indicated he\u2019s not in a position to take part in the opening round of the 2024 Supercars Championship.\u201d In a statement on behalf of Supercars, CEO Shane Howard said: \u201cWe understand the gravity of Brodie\u2019s decision and the challenges he may be facing at this time. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at Supercars, we wish Brodie all the best, and we sincerely hope to witness his return to the Repco Supercars Championship in the future.\u201d Photo by: Edge Photographics Brodie Kostecki, Erebus Motorsport Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Hazelwood is expected to join the team next week to test two newly-built Erebus Camaros alongside new teammate Jack Le Brocq. Ironically, the two drivers were teammates at Matt Stone Racing teammate in 2022. Whatever happens prior to the second round of the Supercars Championship at Albert Park on 21-24 March, even a temporary absence by Kostecki is a significant blow to Erebus, which won the 2023 Team\u2019s title and took first and fifth in the Drivers\u2019 Championship. Last season Le Brocq finished the Drivers\u2019 Championship in 12th with MSR, and Hazelwood 21st with Blanchard Racing Team. It was reported on Tuesday that Kostecki has split with Erebusand will sit out the 2024 season. Motorsport.com understands that there have been tensions within the Erebus team for some time, with Kostecki reportedly having a major fall-out with the squad on the eve of the Tailem Bend round in August of last year. With Kostecki under contract at Erebus, it looks unlikely he would be released to join another team. That would mean that he would be unlikely to participate even as a co-driver in the series\u2019 endurance events, the Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000.",

        "date": "2024-01-30 17:19:35",
        "body": "NASCAR\u2019s return to the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval track in 2024 seems to already be paying dividends in terms of ticket sales. In an interview with Motorsport.com, IMS president Doug Boles said ticket sales for the Cup Series\u2019 first race on the 2.5-mile oval since 2020 have been up year-over-year since the announcement of its return last September. After lagging attendance, NASCAR and IMS moved the annual Cup race on to the IMS Road Course in 2021, 2022 and 2023. With the introduction of the Next Gen car in the Cup Series, NASCAR decided to return to oval layout this year, which coincides with the 30th anniversary of the inaugural event in 1994, won by Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon. \u201cSo, if you compare year over year, like this date, this many days from the race, we are up and we\u2019ve been up really every day since we announced we were going back to the oval,\u201d Boles said of ticket sales for the 400-mile Cup race on July 21. \u201cPleasantly surprised with how that\u2019s going. So, I think that that bodes well. We\u2019ve gotten a ton of positive feedback from fans who are excited that it\u2019s on the oval. We\u2019ve got a lot of people who had tickets previously who hadn\u2019t come since 2019, which was the last time fans could have seen the Cup cars on the oval (COVID-19 affected the 2020 race). \u201cSo, all indications are really positive, and we should be in a lot better spot in terms of attendance. I just think there\u2019s excitement and prestige obviously with the oval that that brings that back.\u201d While the Cup series\u2019 races on the IMS road course have certainly not lacked in excitement, the push to revive the Brickyard 400 gained momentum with improved racing the Next Gen car has provided on intermediate and larger speedways. The Xfinity Series will also return to the oval track with a 250-mile race on July 20. The Cup race will follow the next day. Driver-turned-Fox TV analyst Kevin Harvick is the most recent winner on the oval, winning the 2020 edition. Boles said the track will do heavy promotion of NASCAR\u2019s return to the iconic oval during its month of May activities leading up to the Indianapolis 500. \u201cPeople are excited about the prestige of it and getting a chance to see the Cup cars back on the oval,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leverage the 500 customer when they\u2019re here for the Indy 500 to make sure that they know that the Cup guys are coming back and that they\u2019re going to be on the oval. \u201cThen the summer will be completely about focusing on the fact that they\u2019re back on the oval. And that\u2019s really the big buying period for us is that June, July; those last six weeks leading into the Brickyard are really the times that you\u2019ll really see a pretty heavy promotion around the Brickyard 400.\u201d One popular advantage of NASCAR utilizing the road course layout will disappear with the move to the oval \u2013 holding a combination weekend with the NTT IndyCar Series. That isn\u2019t likely to return anytime soon at IMS, Boles said. \u201cAs a race fan who loved the idea that the NASCAR Cup cars and the NTT IndyCar Series cars are on the same race track the same weekend, that was a pretty big deal for a race fan, I think, to be able to see those two series running together,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the speedway standpoint, I also understand that if you're an NTT IndyCar Series driver, more diversity of tracks is what makes that series so special. So, having two road course races at the speedway, while it worked out and was nice, I think at some level it would be nice to add a different venue. \u201cAs a fan, I hope what we did is we showed that it works, it\u2019s great for the sport and that there\u2019s another venue where we can continue to host IndyCar and NASCAR at the same time on the same weekend.\u201d",

        "body": "Rally Sardinia will debut a new condensed World Rally Championship format this year, comprising a competitive stage distance under 300 kilometres. The Italian gravel rally, which hosts the sixth round of the championship from 30 May-2 June, has revealed an all-new format that will be covered in 48 hours. The rally will be held over 16 competitive stages covering a total of 266.48 kilometres and will be based around the city of Alghero, which last hosted the event in 2022. According to an announcement by rally organisers, the compact route is based on new FIA 2025 guidelines, which are yet to be officially released. There has been a push from within the WRC to have the ability to run more condensed rallies. It is understood a proposal to condense events is part of package of rule changes the championship wishes to implement in the future. Previously, rallies have operated a stage distance in excess of 300 kilometres. \u201cThe adventure of the Rally Italia Sardegna will continue this year with a compact route based on the new FIA guidelines from 2025, with the entire race condensed in just 48 hours. The Rally Italia Sardegna will return to Alghero this year, with the service park set up, as two years ago,\u201d read a statement from the organisers. Under this new format, the rally will begin with the shakedown held on Friday morning before the first of four stages beginning at 1330 local time. Friday afternoon will feature two loops of two stages followed by an end-of-day service. Saturday will feature eight stages split by a midday tyre-fitting zone. The schedule will see crews complete two passes of four stages before returning to Alghero for an end of day service. Four stages will complete Sunday\u2019s leg, with the rally set to finish at 1315 local time. This format change is the first sign that WRC events could undertake on a new guise from 2025 onwards. It arrives during a period of change currently ongoing within the championship, including the introduction of new points-scoring system that made its debut at the season opener in Monte Carlo last weekend.",

The trio of Indy Dontje, Philip Ellis and Russell Ward were part both winning squads, but this latest one featuredDaniel Morad, who closed out the contest in the No. 57 Mercedes AMG GT3. It was a commanding performance by the foursome, which were steadily in command, especially throughout the backend of IMSA\u2019s season opening endurance classic. However, it didn\u2019t come without some drama as a roughly 30s lead was swept away by the final caution and added pressure in the final half hour. In the end, though, Morad was able to hold serve and win by 2.731s over the No. 21 AF Corse Ferrari 296 GT3 of Kei Cozzolino, Francois Heriau,Simon MannandMiguel Molina. \u201cObviously, I wanted it to be an easy victory,\u201d said Morad, who also GTD class win at Daytona with Alegra Motorsports in 2017. \u201cWe all did an amazing job building the gaps throughout all the stints. It wasn't just me. It was every single person on the team, engineering staff. The whole prep on the car was phenomenal. A lot easier this year than last year having a car that was designed for the race. \u201cBut if that didn't happen, then I probably wouldn't be here right now. Everything happens for a reason, and I'm super pumped to be driving with these guys. We all did this together. It wasn't one specific person. We all put in a hell of an effort.\u201d Photo by: Michael L. Levitt /Motorsport Images #57 WINWARD Racing Mercedes AMG GT3: Russell Ward, Philip Ellis, Indy Dontje, Daniel Morad Ward referenced the effort put in at the BoP (Balance of Performance) test ahead of the twice-around-the-clock. While that helped the car come alive into the night, part of that was aided by the new tire compound. \u201cWe had a bit of an advantage there and got to experience the new tire, which was quite a bit different from last year's tire,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWe just kind of set the call for the long run. That's what we all like, and it's nice to put a fast lap together, but at the end of the day, you just want to be good on the long run. I think the engineers did a great job of doing that.\u201d And now with two wins for Winward around Daytona International Speedway\u2019s 12-turn, 3.56-mile road course since 2021, Ward suggested it demonstrates the mentality of the team. \u201cIt's a constant evolution in racing,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIf you're not pushing the limits and trying to improve every year and someone else is, someone else is going to beat you. \u201cThat's kind of the passion that we have. We've had a pretty consistent crew over the past five years who have stayed with us and really helped us be successful. We try to keep the same drivers on board. We want to develop as a team and move forward as one. \u201cThis one is pretty special to me. The first one wasn't luck, of course. Everybody put their work in. But to come here and do it again, we've been pretty close the past two years, but just really haven't had the luck to get it done, and to come back and close it off for the second time in 2024 is a great feeling.\u201d Ward went on to note the biggest reason to how they were able to score the victory, saying: \u201cThe key to winning this race is just keeping the car clean. The car that we won in 2021 is sitting in the shop in the same condition without a scratch on it, and this one, likewise, not a scratch on it. Really awesome to see it.\u201d",

The current technical formula in MotoGP will change in 2027, with one of the chief changes coming in the form of engine displacement being reduced from 1000cc to 850cc. MotoGP will also move to 100% sustainable fuels from 2027, while it is thought major changes to the current aerodynamic rules will be made. During the launch of the KTM-backed Tech3 team earlier this week, Beirer offered an update on how discussions over the 2027 regulations were going between MotoGP and the manufacturers. \u201cI feel some very smart decisions have been made for the \u201827 regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe one or the other idea we should discuss if it would not make sense to make the changes even earlier. \u201cBut in general to take out the little bit of extreme technology that is influencing the riding style, the riding itself, we should take out a little bit to give the tools a bit more back to the rider to decide when to brake, when to pass, how to manage the race, how to manage the front tyre. \u201cBut looking to 27, reducing engine capacity, getting rid of ride height devices, limiting the aerodynamic size of the wings and stuff, they are all the right decisions for sure.

The sprint races came on board, it doubled the amount of races. \u201cBut we really love it because we think we give this extra to the public and spectators who come to the races. \u201cAnd everyone at home watches racing on Saturday rather than a qualifying practice. \u201cBut we must be very careful [not] to go over the limit and I don\u2019t make a secret that our wishing number for the total of races, we see a limit reaching somewhere around 18, not 22. \u201cBut it\u2019s a global championship, so we want to be involved. We will not complain too badly about it, but our information is on the table that clearly we would rather have two or three races less but in the same format. \u201cI would not question mark the sprint races. I think they are really good for the sport. \u201cIf you see most of the races where we have a big crown coming out and what\u2019s going in the media, how all you guys report about MotoGP, I feel it\u2019s an amazing sport and we just need to continue doing the right things.\u201d Changes to the 2024 calendar are expected, however, following news that the Argentina GP is in serious doubt due to government spending cuts in the country.",

        "body": "Haas understands a \"significant part\" about the tyre problems that held it back in Formula 1 last year but admits it does not fully comprehend the issues at play. The American-owned outfit spent much of 2023 trying to get to the bottom of why its VF-23 car was fast in qualifying but would struggle so much to look after its tyres in the race. An upgrade introduced at the United States Grand Prix to help improve the aerodynamic characteristics did not deliver a clear answer either about what direction it needed to head in, and drivers Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg ended up going different routes. As the team prepares for the launch of its 2024 car, new Haas boss Ayao Komatsu is clear that much of the focus of its winter efforts has been on addressing the tyre issue, which he says it has not yet been fully resolved. \"I don't think we understand everything,\" admitted Komatsu. \"I think we understand a significant part of it, but the only proof is if you can produce a car that can deal with the problem. \"I don't like to sit here and say that we understand it 100%, We don't. But we have a decent idea of why and where we need to focus on.\" Trying to address aggressive tyre problems in races is not a new phenomenon for Haas, as it has faced similar issues in the past \u2013 such as in 2019 when it suffered from warm-up issues. Komatsu, who has been with Haas since it was founded, says there may be some common factors at play that could revolve around how the squad's different departments integrate with each other. Photo by: Andy Hone /Motorsport Images Ayao Komatsu, Chief Engineer, Haas F1 Team, and Kevin Magnussen, Haas F1 Team, on the grid \"From '19 to '23, the programme is very different,\" he said. \"It may look the same, but it is very different. But the working practice is the core. \"If we are not working in a very integrated manner, communicating properly between the aero department in Italy to the tyre department in the UK, that is a problem. \"That working culture and practice is something I am going to focus on improving.

        "body": "Seeds of Life? Samples Taken From Asteroid Ryugu Contain Traces of Comet Particles Space 02 February 2024 By Matt Williams, Universe Today Asteroid Ryugu, as imaged by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. The red arrow marks the sampling location. (JAXA/Hayabusa2 via Universe Today) On December 5th, 2020 , Japan's Hayabusa2 mission successfully returned samples it had collected from the Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) 162173 Ryugu home. Since asteroids are basically leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, analysis of these samples will provide insight into what conditions were like back then. In particular, scientists are interested in determining how organic molecules were delivered throughout the Solar System shortly after its formation (ca. 4.6 billion years ago), possibly offering clues as to how (and where) life emerged. The samples have already provided a wealth of information, including more than 20 amino acids , vitamin B3 (niacine), and interstellar dust . According to a recent study by a team of Earth scientists from Tohoku University , the Ryugu samples also showed evidence of micrometeoroid impacts that left patches of melted glass and minerals. The carbonaceous material found in the melt splash shows a spongy texture and contains small iron sulfide inclusions. (\u00a9 Megumi Matsumoto et al., Science Advances , 2024) According to their findings, these micrometeoroids likely came from other comets and contained carbonaceous materials similar to primitive organic matter typically found in ancient cometary dust. The team was led by Megumi Matsumoto, an assistant professor from the Earth Science Department at Tohoku University's Graduate School of Science. He was joined by researchers from the Division of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Kyoto University, the CAS Center for Excellence in Deep Earth Science, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and NASA's Johnson Space Center. The details of their findings were presented in a paper that recently appeared in the journal Science Advances . Like the Moon and other airless bodies, Ryugu has no protective atmosphere and does not experience weathering or erosion. This ensures that craters caused by past impacts on its surface (which is directly exposed to space) are carefully preserved despite the passage of eons. These impacts generate intense heat that leaves behind melted patches of glass (aka. \"melt splashes\"), which quickly solidify in the vacuum of space. These impacts cause changes to the composition of the asteroid's surface materials, revealing information about the history of impacts. After analyzing the Ryugu samples, Matsumoto and her colleagues found melt splashes ranging in size from 5 to 20 micrometers. Their composition suggests they came from cometary sources that impacted Ryugu while it was in a near-Earth orbit. Left: A melt splash discovered on a Ryugu sample surface. The melt splash shows a round shape. Right: CT slice image of the melt splash exhibiting abundant voids inside. (\u00a9 Megumi Matsumoto et al., Science Advances, 2024) \"Our 3D CT imaging and chemical analyses showed that the melt splashes consist mainly of silicate glasses with voids and small inclusions of spherical iron sulfides,\" said Matsumoto in a recent Tohoku University news release . \"The chemical compositions of the melt splashes suggest that Ryugu's hydrous silicates mixed with cometary dust.\" Their analysis revealed small carbonaceous materials with a spongy texture indicative of nano-pores, small voids caused by the release of water vapor from hydrous silicates. This vapor was subsequently captured in the melt splashes, which also contained silicate glasses rich in magnesium and iron (Mg-Fe) and iron-nickel sulfides. The carbonaceous materials are similar in texture to primitive organic matter observed in cometary dust but differ in composition \u2013 lacking nitrogen and oxygen. Said Matsumoto: \"We propose that the carbonaceous materials formed from cometary organic matter via the evaporation of volatiles, such as nitrogen and oxygen, during the impact-induced heating. This suggests that cometary matter was transported to the near-Earth region from the outer solar system. This organic matter might be the small seeds of life once delivered from space to Earth.\" Looking ahead, the team hopes to examine more Ryugu samples that will provide further insights into how primitive organic materials were delivered to Earth billions of years ago. Similarly, scientists at NASA's Johnson Space Center recently completed the careful process of removing the samples collected by the OSIRIS-REx mission from their sample container. Analysis of these samples will reveal the composition and history of asteroid Bennu, another NEA that will provide vital information on how our Solar System evolved.

        "body": "Several Bizarre Visual Symptoms Shown to Be a Strong Predictor For Alzheimer's Health 02 February 2024 By David Nield (LWA/Stone/Getty Images) The rare condition posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) involves strange, troubling issues with vision and spatial awareness \u2013 including difficulty judging distances, seeing movement, and recognizing objects \u2013 and a new study highlights its close relationship to Alzheimer's disease in more detail than ever before. PCA and Alzheimer's have long been linked with each other, because they share a lot of the same pathological changes in the brain . However, the rarity of PCA has made it hard for researchers to fully assess it in relation to Alzheimer's. To address that, an international team of researchers analyzed data on 1,092 individuals with PCA, finding that it was a very strong predictor for Alzheimer's: in 94 percent of cases, tell-tale Alzheimer's brain changes were observed, and were most likely contributing to PCA. \"We need more awareness of PCA so that it can be flagged by clinicians,\" says neuropsychologist Marianne Chapleau from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). \"Most patients see their optometrist when they start experiencing visual symptoms and may be referred to an ophthalmologist who may also fail to recognize PCA. We need better tools in clinical settings to identify these patients early on and get them treatment.\" One positive effect this study could have is getting people with PCA symptoms checked out as early as possible. The average onset age for the disorder is 59 \u2013 several years younger than it is for Alzheimer's \u2013 and the average time between symptom onset and the first diagnostic visit is 3.8 years. The study noted plenty of similarities between PCA and Alzheimer's in terms of the levels of amyloid and tau in the brain, with build-ups of these proteins long associated with the onset of dementia. However, there were also some differences, which could give researchers clues as to the best courses of treatment . \"Patients with PCA have more tau pathology in the posterior parts of the brain, involved in the processing of visuospatial information, compared to those with other presentations of Alzheimer's,\" says neuropsychologist Renaud La Joie from UCSF. \"This might make them better suited to anti-tau therapies.\" The researchers behind the new study are hopeful that their work can lead to a greater understanding of how Alzheimer's can manifest itself, and how both Alzheimer's and PCA start to get a grip on the brain . With this research covering people in 16 different countries, it's the most comprehensive review of PCA yet \u2013 and because of its close links to Alzheimer's, it gives us a different perspective on dementia than we otherwise get. \"From a scientific point of view, we really need to understand why Alzheimer's is specifically targeting visual rather than memory areas of the brain,\" says neurologist Gil Rabinovici from UCSF. \"Our study found that 60 percent of patients with PCA were women \u2013 better understanding of why they appear to be more susceptible is one important area of future research.\" The research has been published in Lancet Neurology .",

        "body": "Scientists Find Mysterious, Oozing Black Eggs Almost 4 Miles Below The Ocean's Surface Nature 02 February 2024 By Carly Cassella Deep-sea flatworm egg capsules. (Kakui and Tsuyuki, Biology Letters, 2024) A clutch of tiny black eggs, discovered by a remotely operated vehicle in the abyss of the Pacific Ocean, is the first concrete evidence that deep-sea flatworms exist more than 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) deep. At first, when the undersea vehicle shone its light on the mysterious black spheres, researchers at the University of Tokyo in Japan didn't even know what they were looking at. Marine researcher Yasunori Kano, who was operating the ROV that day, was intrigued, and he decided to retrieve the capsules from their resting place around 6,200 meters (20,341 feet or 3.85 miles) deep in a trench of the northwest Pacific. Once out of the water, Kano noticed that most of the black spheres were attached to rock, and were torn and empty. He sent four intact ones to Hokkaido University invertebrate biologists, Keiichi Kakui and Aoi Tsuyuki. Upon examination, the duo found each leathery casing, or 'cocoon', was roughly 3 millimeters wide and contained three to seven developing flatworms. \"When we opened the egg capsules, a milky liquid \u2026 that might have been yolk was observed along with the flatworms,\" write Kakui and Tsuyuki in their paper. Deep-sea flatworm cocoons, collected roughly 6,200 meters deep. (a) Egg capsules on rock fragment. (b) Partly opened egg capsule with three spherical-stage flatworms. (c) Later-stage flatworm extracted from egg capsule. (d) Cracked egg capsule with seven flatworms. (e) Same egg capsule, half of shell removed. (f) Later-stage flatworm extracted from egg capsule. (g) Cross section of individual flatworm. ( Kakui and Tsuyuki, Biology Letters , 2024 ) Sampling the DNA of the worm embryos, the duo found they belonged to an undescribed and unnamed species of platyhelminth, most closely related to two suborders that exist in shallower waters. Kakui told Rachel Funnell of IFLScience that when he received the eggs from Kano, he didn't realize how rare they were. The embryos looked \" indistinguishable \" from shallow-water flatworms. All flatworms are hermaphrodites , meaning they can produce both male and female gametes. Shallow water species reproduce sexually by laying eggs in leathery cocoons, which are usually attached to a substrate. Today, scientists know next to nothing about deep-sea, free-living flatworms, let alone how they reproduce. Prior to this discovery, the deepest evidence of a 'potential platyhelminth' was found on a piece of sunken wood just over 5,200 meters deep. Not only was this creature not confirmed as a flatworm, it was unclear if the wood sank with a shallow-water species, or if a deep-sea flatworm found the wood after it sank. The deepest ocean flatworm that was confirmed prior to this discovery was found at a depth of 3,232 meters. \"This study provides the deepest record for free-living flatworms and the first information on their early life stages in the abyssal zone, which were very similar to those in shallow-water forms,\" conclude Kakui and Tsuyuki. The eggs appear to have been laid by at least two adults of the same species. Given that the embryos were at different stages of development when retrieved from the deep seabed, the cocoons were probably laid over time, not all at once. This indicates that shallow-water flatworms may have colonized deeper and deeper habitats over time. Why they did so and how they did so remains a mystery. The study was published in Biology Letters .",

        "body": "Scientists Determine The Dog Breeds That Live Longest \u2013 And It's All in The Nose Nature 02 February 2024 By Daniel Lawler, AFP Small dogs with long noses, such as whippets and miniature dachshunds, live for years longer than large flat-faced breeds such as English bulldogs, new research said on Thursday . The study , which is based on data from more than half a million dogs across the UK, aims to help people planning to get a dog ensure they choose a breed that will have a long and healthy life. Lead author Kirsten McMillan, data manager at UK charity Dogs Trust, said it was the first study to look at how life expectancy varies across such a broad range of factors, including breed, size, face shape and gender. \"A medium-sized, flat-face male like an English bulldog is nearly three times more likely to live a shorter life than a small-sized, long-faced female, like a miniature dachshund or an Italian greyhound,\" she told AFP. Out of more than 150 breeds and crossbreeds across the UK, the median life expectancy for all dogs was 12.5 years. But for French bulldogs \u2013 ranked the most popular breed in the United States last year by the American Kennel Club \u2013 the number was just 9.8 years. Previous research has suggested that the short noses of flat-faced \u2013 also called brachycephalic \u2013 dogs allow them to more closely resemble human babies, rendering them particularly cute to their owners. But those short noses also cause significant breathing problems. Dan O'Neill, chair of the campaign organisation Brachycephalic Working Group, said the study further highlighted the \"health and welfare crisis\" suffered by these hugely popular breeds. \"It is crucial that the public prioritises health over what they might think looks 'cute' and we urge anyone considering getting a flat-faced breed to stop and think,\" he said . - Designer breeds? - The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports , found that the dogs with the longest life expectancy are Lancashire heelers with a median of 15.4 years, followed by Tibetan spaniels (15.2 years) and miniature dachshunds (14 years). Labradors, the most popular breed in the UK, scored 13.1 years. Female dogs tended to live a little longer than males, with a life expectancy of 12.7 years compared to 12.4. The study also found that pure breeds lived a little longer than crossbreeds \u2013- the opposite finding of previous research. This was probably due to the dawning of the \"era of the designer breed\", with deliberate crossbreeds such as labradoodles, cockapoos and pomskies becoming increasingly fashionable, McMillan said. \"We're no longer just talking about mutts or unknown mixes versus purebred dogs,\" she said. For those considering buying or adopting a dog, it is important to be aware that some breeds will need more trips to the vet, McMillan emphasised. But vet bills aside, a bigger consideration is the love and affection potential owners will invest in their hairy companions. \"These animals are members of our family,\" McMillan said. \"We want to ensure that we're doing everything we can to provide them with a long, happy and healthy life.\" \u00a9 Agence France-Presse",

        "date": "2024-02-02 14:03:36",
        "body": "Haas has unveiled the livery it will run on its yet-to-be revealed 2024 Formula 1 challenger the VF-24. Compared to the colour scheme the American team ran on its VF-23 2023 car, the new livery is not a substantial change, with the main area of alteration being the upper nose section. This is now predominantly black compared to being white last year, which makes the VF-24 appear dark from all angles compared to its predecessor. While Haas has only released renders of the VF-24\u2019s livery so far, it will run its new car for the first time at a Silverstone shakedown on 11 February. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the VF-24 running and racing \u2013 a sentiment I know I share with our partners and indeed the entire team,\u201d said Gene Haas, theHaas F1 team\u2019s owner and chairman. \u201cInNico HulkenbergandKevin Magnussen, we also know we\u2019ve got a great pair of drivers behind the wheel. \u201cTheir experience will prove invaluable again as we develop our programme through the year. \u201cWe\u2019ve used the off-season to put the processes in place to be better and ultimately improve our overall performance. Soon we get to see how we\u2019re doing.\u201d Haas VF-24 livery Photo by: Haas F1 Team The biggest story of Haas\u2019s off-season concerned the axing of long-time team principal and effective co-founder of the squad, Guenther Steiner. He was replaced by former Haas director of engineering, Ayao Komatsu, when Steiner did not have his contract renewed by Gene Haas after the 2023 season concluded. It was a disappointing campaign for Haas, as it slipped back from eighth in 2022 to finish last in 2023 \u2013 its season dominated by failing to fix an in-race tyre management problem caused by the aerodynamic layout of the VF-23. In a Haas team statement, Komatsu said the squad is \u201crealistic about our expectations for the VF-24 to start\u201d, while adding, \u201cit\u2019s still an exciting moment in any F1 season to showcase the [livery]\u201d. But in a frank admission, he stated that he expects Haas \u201cout of the gates in Bahrain [when the sole test and first race will take place]\u2026 I still think we\u2019re going to be towards the back of the grid, if not last\u201d. Komatsu claims this is because the resources dedicated to the team\u2019s 2023 late-season upgrade package introduced at Austin \u2013 which ultimately failed to add any performance to its 2023 car or solve its main issues \u2013 had been taken away from the development of the VF-24. \u201cThe reason our launch-spec car is not going to be quick enough in Bahrain is not because of the quality of the people we have here, but it\u2019s because we started late and then we stopped for two months to do the Austin upgrade,\u201d said Komatsu. \u201cIt really diverted resource, so we lost time there, but the team is finding good gains in the wind tunnel so that\u2019s positive and in terms of characteristics, it\u2019s going in the right direction. \u201cThe focus is to have a good test program for Bahrain so that we come away from the test having quality data for the team to analyse and understand which direction to develop the car. \u201cThis means understanding the strength and weakness of the VF-24 accurately, then put a coherent plan together to produce updates on the car, which hasn\u2019t happened previously.\u201d Haas as has also announced that its former chief designer Andrea De Zordo has been promoted to technical director, replacing Simone Resta in that role after he left the team where he had been on secondment fromFerrariat the end of last year. Haas is now recruiting for De Zordo\u2019s replacement as chief designer but is expected to promote from within its F1 organisation. Haas VF-24 livery Photo by: Haas F1 Team",

        "date": "2024-02-02 13:07:02",
        "body": "Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff says that the team will be fair to both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell as it enters the former\u2019s final season in the camp. Wolff says he has no concerns about potentially having to block the flow of information on future development to Hamilton, suggesting that it\u2019s too early to make a call on how that process might work. Logic suggests that Hamilton will henceforth be frozen out of any discussions on 2026, when the new F1 regulations come in. However, inevitably there will be a crossover between development work undertaken to improve this year\u2019s W15 and the design process for next year\u2019s W16,when Hamilton will be at rival Ferrari. \u201cI think what I've always tried to do as a team principal, and all of us atMercedes, is to be transparent, and fair,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cAnd nothing's going to change in that respect in 2024. \u201cWe owe it to our principles and our racing intent, how we go about, and we will respect that. And I will be sure that the drivers will respect it. \u201cIn terms of the development going forward, I think this is something which we need to look at. The regulations stay pretty much the same. And when it comes to 2025, we will evaluate later in the season what it means in terms of technical information, but that's not something that bothers me at all. \u201cWe have engineers that leave us and go to other teams and the notice periods are sometimes as short as six months. \u201cSo I don't have any doubt in Lewis' integrity, in terms of sharing information. And in that respect, we want to make sure that this is a successful season for both drivers, and a successful season for Mercedes, and all of us will give our utmost to achieve that.\u201d Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG Photo by: James Sutton /Motorsport Images Wolff suggested that he\u2019ll enjoy the extra challenge associated with juggling the flow of information to a driver who is leaving the team. \u201cDefinitely a new situation to manage, for followers of the team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is something that when you focus on the really short term, and this is the racing team that's being deployed to run the product, that doesn't have a big impact on everything that's happening going forward on the development side. \u201cI'm always interested in new and challenging situations, and balancing 2024 Mercedes interests versus 2025 driver interests is something that we will openly discuss at the beginning, how to manage that, and for sure come to a good outcome between us.\u201d Wolff insisted that the coming season has priority over any thoughts about filling Hamilton\u2019s seat in 2025. \u201cFirst our main focus is on the 2024 season now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've got two excellent drivers. We have Lewis in his final year at Mercedes, and George eager to go back in the car and perform. \u201cWe need to put a car on the track that has more pace than last year's car, and we know how difficult it will be to compete not only with Red Bull, but possibly the other ones. \u201c[With] all the Lewis discussion, something that has not been talked enough is George. George has the potential to be the next lead driver in the team. \u201cHe's of the generation of Lando [Norris] and [Charles] Leclerc and some of the others. I couldn't wish for a [better] new team leader when Lewis leaves. No doubt about that. \u201cWe've such a solid foundation, such a quick and talented and intelligent guy in a car that we just need to take the right choice for the second driver, the second seat.\u201d",

        "body": "Toto Wolff says new contracts for potential Lewis Hamilton replacements Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc have 'bitten' Mercedes, but the Formula 1 team may be \"bold\" with its new signing. The shock news emerged on Thursday that Hamilton will join Ferrari for 2025. This comes only a week after Ferrari re-signed Leclerc, and McLaren retained Norris on \"multi-year\" extensions. While Hamilton's move underlines that F1 driver contracts may contain exit clauses, Mercedes team boss Wolff appears to have poured cold water on the prospect of going after Leclerc and Norris - both of whom were previously seen as leading candidates to one day succeed Hamilton. Addressing the media for the first time since the Hamilton revelation, Wolff conceded that the recent driver market developments had 'bitten' Mercedes. Also praising the credentials of George Russell to lead the team now, Wolff said: \"We've such a solid foundation, such a quick and talented and intelligent guy [Russell] in a car that we just need to take the right choice for the second driver, the second seat. \"It's not something I want to be rushed into. I guess that a few contracts have been signed a few weeks ago that we would have looked at. \"That would have been interesting, but the timing here bit us a bit.\" He continued: \"If you told me two days ago that Lewis was going to Ferrari, I didn't think it was possible. So, situations and things can change quickly. \"Contracts are only as good as [long as] the driver or the teams want to race. And who knows what's happening in the driver market that could be unexpected and opportunities for us.\" Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG Photo by: Mark Sutton /Motorsport Images Wolff added that Mercedes could use this situation to be \"bold\" with its driver choice since the timing of Hamilton's exit news has given Mercedes \"a long time to decide what we want to do\". \"Almost, in a way, I always like change because change provides you with opportunity. \"In the same way we embraced the Nico [Rosberg shock retirement at the end of 2016] situation, and that was equally like from one moment to the other unexpected, I'm really looking forward to taking the right decisions for the team together with my colleagues and who's going to be in the seat next year. \"Maybe it's a chance to do something bold.\" One way for Mercedes to be bold would be to fast-track the career of junior driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli, who won the Italian and German F4 titles in the same year before bagging the Formula Regional European Championship crown last season. In 2024, he will contest FIA F2 with Prema Racing. However, Wolff stressed the importance of the Italian focusing on his F2 campaign rather than getting distracted by any rumours linking him to the vacant Mercedes seat from 2025.",

Komatsu took over from Guenther Steiner at the start of this year, after team owner Gene Haas felt it was time for the squad to embark on a change of direction to move itself off the bottom of the constructors\u2019 championship. It is understood that one of the key disagreement points between Haas and Steiner was over how much investment the team needed to move forward. While Steiner felt that it required extra cash if it was to take on competitors, Haas believed that a better route to success was making more of what it already has. Komatsu is currently undertaking a review of the entireHaasoperation to work out what changes are needed to help it improve. And while the outfit is unique in F1 for the nature of its customer relationship withFerrari, where it takes as many car components as it can, Komatsu does not feel that this is an element in why it is not achieving all it wants. \u201cFor me, it's not more to do with working with Ferrari, it's more internally we need to look at it first and how effective we do certain operations,\u201d he said. Photo by:Motorsport Images Ayao Komatsu, Haas F1 Team, in the Team Principals' Press Conference \u201cI don't see the relationship with Ferrari being the main, let's say, constraint at this minute. Okay, once we get to a certain stage, then of course we will look at what's holding us up. And then maybe that relationship comes into it. But currently for me, that's not my main focus. \u201cThe relationship with Ferrari is very good. And then the PU, they supply to us, we buy from them, it's very competitive.\u201d Komatsu said that it was important for him to quickly understand what are realistic ambitions for Haas in the short, medium and long terms \u2013 as all three timelines needed careful consideration. \u201cYou have got short-term vision, medium-term vision and long-term vision, and you have got to have all those,\u201d he said, \u201cBut at the same time, in the short term, there are plenty of things we can do better. \u201cI'd like to see, once we do that, how far we can get to. Then there will be a parallel discussion going: 'Okay, in order to get to the next stage, what areas do we need to improve?' \u201cIs it investment, etc?

        "date": "2024-02-02 10:51:43",
        "body": "Former AlphaTauri Formula 1 driver Nyck de Vries has lost a legal case initiated by a company that invested in his career by providing him with a loan. The Amsterdam District Court has decreed thatDe Vrieswill have to repay the \u20ac250,000 loan and, in addition, pay half of both his salary and any sponsorship income he earned during his partial F1 season with AlphaTauri up to July 2023. The Dutchman is now considering an appeal against the decision. De Vries obtained the loan from Jeroen Schothorst\u2019s Investrand company in 2018, when he needed to top up the budget for his Prema Formula 2 drive. It was agreed that if De Vries became an active F1 driver by 2022, Investrand would take 50% of his income for as long as he competed at the top level. If he didn\u2019t make it to F1 by that time, Investrand would write the loan off. The company later agreed that his activities as a test driver for Mercedes would not count. A complication arose when, at the 2022 Italian GP, reserve driver De Vries was called in at the last minute as a substitute for the ill Alex Albon at Williams. He duly finished ninth in the race and did enough to catch the attention of Red Bull, which led to him getting the AlphaTauri seat for the following year. Having lost his drive in the middle of 2023, De Vries has since returned to Formula E and WEC with Mahindra and Toyota respectively. De Vries now races for Mahindra in Formula E, with little success so far A dispute arose with Investrand over the 2022 Monza appearance and whether or not that constituted a race deal or was part of his testing activities, as that would make the difference between the loan being written off or the 50% agreement being triggered. In aninitial summary court proceeding early last year, the judge sided with De Vries, noting that \"it is true that he participated in F1 on 11 September 2022 at the Italian Grand Prix, but he did so as a reserve driver. He was not contracted as a race driver at that time. He was merely filling in for another driver with appendicitis.\u201d The judge also backed De Vries regarding a claim that he had not kept Investrand fully informed of the details of his contracts over the years. De Vries indicated to the media at the time that he had in effect won and he hoped that the matter was over, but Investrand now stresses that last year's proceedings were mainly about obtaining information and just a first step towards the main case, which was heard this week in the Amsterdam District Court. This time the judge backed Inverstrand, confirming that De Vries could not rely on his Mercedes testing contract to override the fact that he took part in the 2022 Italian GP as a race driver within the timeframe of the original agreement. He will thus have to repay the \u20ac250,000 loan plus interest, along with half of his 2023 AlphaTauri earnings. Nyck de Vries, AlphaTauri AT04 Photo by: Zak Mauger /Motorsport Images \u201cWe supported Nyck at a crucial moment in his career, when no one else wanted to do so,\u201d said Schothorst. \u201cI am happy that the judge has now ruled in our favour, although I of course regret that this procedure was necessary. \u201cWe would have preferred to reach an arrangement without procedures through proper consultation, but unfortunately our attempts to do so were resolutely rejected by Nyck and his lawyer. \u201cThis made going to court inevitable. That does not alter the fact that I wish Nyck all possible success in the continuation of his already impressive motorsport career, even though it will no longer be in F1.\" De Vries\u2019s lawyer Jeroen Bedaux challenged the decision, noting that De Vries had won on some elements such as any extra payments claimed to the end of 2022, while also indicating that there may yet be an appeal. \u201cThe court's interpretation of the agreement isnot consistent with what De Vries in any event intended at the time he concluded the agreement,\u201d he told Motorsport.com. \u201cAnd De Vries has also fully and conscientiously fulfilled his obligations up to and including 2022, which has also been confirmed in court. \u201cThat De Vries was nevertheless ordered to repay the loan and to pay fixed and variable interest regarding the first months of 2023 is therefore at odds with what the parties have agreed, which is why De Vries is still considering an appeal.\u201d He also suggested that counting the 2022 Monza reserve appearance as a race drive was \u201ca very creative interpretation of the agreement\u201d.",

        "body": "The Japanese Grand Prix will continue to be held at Suzuka until at least 2029 after Formula 1 agreed a five-year contract extension with owners Honda. The news will be welcomed by drivers and fans alike who feared that the series is moving too far away from its classic venues. Prior to the agreement the event was one of the last with no guaranteed place on the calendar beyond this season after a run of deals that has seen most races secure their spots well into the future. The last remaining race that currently has a contract that runs out after this season\u2019s edition is Silverstone, but it\u2019s believed that a deal to keep the British GP firmly on the schedule is not far away. The new Suzuka contract is not as long as those handed to the likes of Australia (running to 2035) and Bahrain (2036), but at five years it is longer than the track\u2019s previous arrangement, which ran for three seasons. While that was due to run out this year, there was never any real doubt that an extended deal would eventually be done, especially given that Honda is committed to a works presence as Aston Martin\u2019s power unit partner from 2026 onwards. The circuit has kept F1 onside by starting on an upgrade programme and by backing a successful fan event in Tokyo last year, which is likely to be repeated this season. The deal also reduces the chances of a proposed street event in Osaka coming to fruition. While the Osaka authorities have indicated that theirs could be a second Japanese event, the chances of F1 agreeing to have two races that are just 130kms apart by road appear to be slim, especially given the busy calendar. Had Suzuka not agreed terms, Osaka\u2019s case would have been much stronger. Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB19 Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool This year\u2019s Japanese GP is being held in April, falling into a slot between Australia and China that is favourable for freight in terms of cost and emissions. \u201cSuzuka is a special circuit and part of the fabric of the sport,\u201d said F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. \u201cSo I am delighted that F1 will continue to race there until at least 2029. \u201cAs we prepare to return to Japan earlier than usual this season, l would like to express my huge gratitude to the promoter and team at Honda MobilityLand for supporting our effort towards greater calendar rationalisation as we look to make the sport more sustainable. \u201cOur fans in Japan embrace F1 with a unique passion and we look forward to working with the promoter to give fans the experience they deserve for years to come.\u201d Honda Mobilityland president Tsuyoshi Saito added: \u201cWe aim to create a sustainable future, and currently we are preparing to welcome many fans for the 2024 F1 Japanese Grand Prix in April, the first time the event will be held in the spring season. \u201cWe will continue to work together with the local communities and government agencies, including Mie Prefecture and Suzuka City, so that Suzuka can continue to be loved by fans around the world and contribute to the prosperity of motorsports culture and industrial development.\u201d",

An initial 108 satellites of a total of around 12,000 \u201cG60 Starlink\u201d satellites are to be launched across 2024.\nSSST and CAS\u2019s Innovation Academy for Microsatellites (IAMCAS) established Shanghai Gesi Aerospace Technology (Genesat) in 2022 to set up satellite manufacturing facilities.\nThe first flat-panel satellite rolled off the assembly line at the G60 digital satellite production factory in Shanghai\u2019s Songjiang District in December 2023. Genesat recently raised funds through investment vehicles under both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai government.\nSSST is understood to be the Chinese side of the former Sino-German KLEO Connect constellation project. That Chinese-European joint venture ended in acrimony and ongoing lawsuits. Meanwhile U.S. technology firm Rivada is planning to use the frequencies previously allocated to KLEO Connect for its own constellation.\nDocumentation filed with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in April likely pertaining to the G60 Starlink project sets out plans for 36 polar orbital planes, each filled with 36 satellites, totaling 1,296 spacecraft. The satellites would operate in the Ku, Q and V bands.\nThe plans now have very strong financial and political backing. The Shanghai government plans announced in October to foster a commercial space ecosystem by 2025. The initiative aims to foster an end-to-end ecosystem encompassing satellites, launch vehicles, related applications and infrastructure.\nTargets include building capacity for an annual output of 50 commercial rockets and 600 commercial satellites.\nG60 Starlink is the second low Earth orbit communications megaconstellation, following the establishment of the China Satellite Network Group in 2021 to run the national 13,000-satellite Guowang (SatNet) project.\nFurthermore, Chinese communications technology corporation Huawei has stated plans to build its own constellation, potentially using optical links, by 2030.\nChina\u2019s nascent megaconstellation projects promise opportunities for the country\u2019s commercial launch service providers, with a number of startups racing to develop large, reusable liquid propellant launch vehicles.\nCAS Space, again under CAS, is aiming to launch its Kinetica-2 rocket in 2025, while Landspace is working on a stainless steel methalox launcher named Zhuque-3. Space Pioneer is targeting June to launch its Falcon 9-class Tianlong-3 rocket.\nNew commercial launch pads at a commercial spaceport on Hainan island will soon begin hosting launches. These will help ease a bottleneck for launch startups.\nThe initiative is one of a number to increase China\u2019s overall access to space and allow the construction of megaconstellations. State-owned CASC is also working to increase the launch rate of its Long March 8 to boost overall launch frequency.\nThe planned communications megaconstellations, together with U.S. projects such as SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, promise enhanced global internet connectivity. These developments also bring geopolitical implications related to national security, surveillance, and technological dominance. They will also heighten issues of orbital space debris and satellite coordination.",

The station features a large habitation and laboratory module with a smaller service module attached to it for power and propulsion.\nThe size of Starlab made it unlikely that it could launch on anything other than Starship. In a presentation at the Space Tech Expo Europe conference in Bremen, Germany, last November, Manfred Jaumann, vice president of low Earth orbit and suborbital programs at Airbus, said the module has a diameter of more than eight meters. That is larger than what can be accommodated on vehicles in service or under development other than Starship.\nStarlab, like Starship, will be made of stainless steel, which Jaumann said was possible because of the existence of large launch vehicles that can place up to 100 tons into low Earth orbit. The module will also be manufactured in a shipyard and completely integrated on the ground before launch, eliminating the need for on-orbit assembly. That cuts the manufacturing time in half to three years, he said, and launch costs by more than 80%.\nWorking with SpaceX, though, means dealing with a potential competitor. SpaceX was one of the companies that received an unfunded NASA Space Act Agreement in June through the agency\u2019s Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities-2 initiative.

        "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 More than 40 members of Congress from California have asked the White House to reverse cuts NASA has imposed on the Mars Sample Return (MSR) program, warning of job losses and a \u201cdecade of lost science.\u201d\nThe Feb. 1 letter to Shalanda Young, director of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, marks an escalation of an earlier request by many of the same members in November to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to undo a slowdown in spending in MSR prompted by uncertainty in fiscal year 2024 appropriations.\nThe letter was led by Reps. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), with 41 other members of California\u2019s congressional delegation signing it. The lead center for MSR, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is in California.\nNASA officials said in November that it would \u201cstart ramping back on activities\u201d related to MSR because of differences in spending bills. A House appropriations bill offers the agency\u2019s full request of $949.3 million for MSR, but its Senate counterpart includes only $300 million.\nNASA, like the rest of the federal government, is operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that funds the agency at 2023 levels, which for MSR is $822.3 million. NASA said the reduction in MSR spending was necessary because of concerns that, if the Senate bill is enacted, MSR could run out of 2024 funding if it spent at the higher 2023 rate for several months.\nIn the letter, the members of Congress rejected that argument. \u201cThis short-sighted and misguided decision will cost hundreds of jobs and a decade of lost science, and it flies in the face of Congressional authority,\u201d they wrote.\nCongress has yet to finalize a full-year 2024 spending package, but have made progress in recent weeks, such as providing allocations to the 12 appropriations subcommittees so they know how much money is available to them. The CR that funds NASA runs through March 8.\nThe letter hints at progress on resolving the difference between the House and Senate funding levels for MSR. \u201cWhile we are extremely concerned that the Senate appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and Science has proposed just $300 million for the program in FY2024, House Appropriations Committee leadership continue to work closely with their colleagues in the Senate on a compromise position,\u201d it states.\nIf the current reductions are not reversed, the letter warns, \u201cthis decision would ensure that JPL will not be able to meet the next launch window and will force the cancellation of billions of dollars in contracts as well as the termination of hundreds of highly skilled employees.\u201d\nThe reductions have already had effects at JPL. The center laid off 100 contractors in early January, most of whom were involved on MSR. JPL cited uncertainty about the budget for 2024 as a key reason for the layoffs and other cost-cutting efforts.\n\u201cWe got direction from NASA to plan for the lower level and we\u2019re doing that systematically,\u201d Laurie Leshin, director of JPL, said in a Jan. 8 interview. \u201cSo, the first thing to happen is to look at where we\u2019re using on-site contractors on MSR, but other places as well, where JPLers could backfill for that.\u201d Those layoffs could extend to full-time staff, she added, if MSR funding ended up closer to the figure in the Senate bill.\nAn added degree of uncertainty is the ongoing agency reassessment of the overall MSR architecture, prompted by an independent review that found the current approach to MSR is behind schedule and over budget. That effort is scheduled to be complete in March.\n\u201cIt is our understanding that the modified mission architecture would simplify the program and reduce annual costs, thereby addressing the concerns expressed about MSR in the FY2024 Senate appropriations bill,\u201d the letter states. NASA has not disclosed publicly any details about any potential alternative mission architectures.",

However, he declined to give a specific date for the launch, saying only that there was a three-day launch period for the mission in mid-February.\n\u201cWe work directly with SpaceX before we announce the exact launch date and time, so that will be announced here in the coming days,\u201d he said. Any launch in that three-day period, he added, would set up a landing attempt on the moon Feb. 22. The company previously said IM-1 would take about a week to go from launch to a landing on the moon.\nIn a social media post Jan. 23, NASA said IM-1 would launch no earlier than Feb. 14, but the agency deleted the post hours later and replaced it one stating the launch would be as soon as mid-February. Other industry sources have also said the launch was planned for Feb. 14.\nAdding to the confusion, NASA said in a separate statement Jan. 31, a few hours after the briefing, that the Crew-8 commercial crew mission by SpaceX was scheduled for launch as soon as Feb. 22. Both Crew-8 and IM-1 will launch from Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Launch Complex 39A, the only pad currently approved for Falcon 9 crew missions as well as equipped to load liquid oxygen and methane propellants into the IM-1 lunar lander while on the pad shortly before liftoff.\nAt a Jan. 25 briefing, Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said Crew-8 would likely launch Feb. 29 or March 1 if IM-1 launched in mid-February, but could be moved up to as soon as Feb. 22 if the lander mission slipped. The NASA post suggests that, at a minimum, SpaceX and Intuitive Machines have yet to confirm their readiness for a mid-February launch.\nIM-1 is carrying six NASA science and technology demonstration payloads, such as a laser retroreflector, stereo camera for studying dust plumes created by the lander\u2019s engines and a radio science instrument. NASA awarded Intuitive Machines a CLPS task order for the IM-1 mission in 2019 that is worth, after modifications, $118 million. The NASA payloads themselves are valued at $10-11 million, said Chris Culbert, NASA CLPS program manager.\nIM-1 will be the second CLPS mission to launch, after Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine lander Jan. 8. That mission, though, was cut short by a propellant leak hours after launch, and the spacecraft reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere Jan. 18.\nAnother lunar lander, the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) by the Japanese space agency JAXA, landed on the moon Jan. 19 but in the wrong orientation because of a thruster malfunction. That deprived the spacecraft of solar power for all but the last few days of the two-week lunar day at its landing site.\n\u201cWe have learned lessons from all of our counterparts that have come before us,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe look at what the failures were that they had, we look at our systems along the way and ensure that we\u2019ve at least thought about those systems\u201d to ensure his company\u2019s lander does suffer a similar problem.\nKearns said it was fortunate that both Astrobotic and JAXA have been \u201copen and transparent\u201d about the problems their missions suffered. \u201cI think that helps other companies,\u201d he said, \u201cunderstand what happened and try to make sure that, in their approach, they wouldn\u2019t fall to the same issue.\u201d",

Take for instance these Early Neolithic skeletons found in a Swedish tomb, which are all missing their skulls. The stone burial chamber (or \"dolmen\") involved was found in Tiarp, near Falk\u00f6ping , and excavated by researchers from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and Kiel University in Germany. They've managed to catalog body parts from the remains of at least 12 people, but not everything is there. For the time being at least, the experts are at a loss to explain where all the heads have gone or why they were taken \u2013 if indeed they were entombed in the first place. It could be theft, a ritual , a series of beheadings, or something else, though there are no signs on the remains to indicate they experienced violence while alive. Part of the excavated grave. (Sj\u00f6gren et al., Journal of Neolithic Archaeology , 2023) \"It's an early grave which dates to the Early Neolithic period, about 3500 BCE,\" says archaeologist Karl-G\u00f6ran Sj\u00f6gren, from the University of Gothenburg. \"Skulls and large bones are missing and may have been removed from the grave. We don't know whether that has to do with burial rituals or what's behind it.\" Of course there will have been plenty of decay over the last few millennia, but that doesn't necessarily explain why so many of the smaller bones at the site are still intact, while skulls and some other larger bones are missing. It's not something that archaeologists often come across, though the creepy occurrence has been reported before: an even older site in Slovakia was found to be missing its skulls , with decapitation, disease, and death cults all floated as possible explanations. \"This differs from what we usually see in megalith graves, i.e. stone burial chambers from the Neolithic period,\" says Sj\u00f6gren. \"Usually, the bones that are missing are smaller bones from feet and hands.\" Besides the remains of humans, the team has also been able to identify bones from rodents, frogs, pigs, and sheep or goats \u2013 though not all of these bones may date from the same time period.

Being able to assess whether or not the adults and youngsters in the grave were related, for example, should make it easier to understand what exactly happened here. \"The preliminary DNA results show that the DNA in the bones is well preserved,\" says Sj\u00f6gren. \"This means we will be able to reconstruct the family relationships between the people in the grave and we are working on that now.\" The research has been published in the Journal of Neolithic Archaeology .",

        "body": "Turns Out There's One Animal Powerful Enough to Mess With Lions' Feeding Habits Environment 02 February 2024 By Tessa Koumoundouros (Manoj Shah/Stone/Getty Images) In a stark example of how everything on our living planet is interconnected , one species of tiny, invasive insects has reduced lions' abilities to feast on zebras. As we humans are causing so many different changes to our environment all at once, it's not always easy to pin the consequence on the disturbance that produced it. So University of Wyoming zoologist Douglas Kamaru and colleagues performed a series of experiments to untangle the mess of species interactions on Kenya's savanna to discover an outsized impact a mere ant is having on the ecosystem's top predator. Invasive big-headed ants ( Pheidole megacephala ) have hitched a ride with us from a Pacific island to many continents, including Africa, likely travelling by potted plant . The researchers compared areas of the savannah that had been invaded by big-headed ants to places these ants had yet to reach. The untouched areas had substantially more tree cover. In the areas with less trees, lions ( Panthera leo ) had less cover from which to ambush zebras ( Equus quagga ) from, leading to almost three times as many zebras escaping from the big cat's grasp. These kind of interdependencies that cross different levels of a food chain are called trophic cascades . There is some evidence lions may be switching to relying on other prey as a consequence, the researchers explain. As whistling thorn tree coverage declined, zebra kills by lions dropped from 67 to 42 percent, while buffalo kills rose from 0 to 42 percent between 2003 to 2020. But it's too early to know the full ramifications of lions' increasing difficulties hunting zebras. So how do ants impact tree coverage? The connections are often hard to see, even in well-studied ecosystems, so we often don't realize they're there until we've hacked them apart and are met with the consequences. It turns out the trees missing from the invasive ants territory, the whistling thorn trees ( Vachellia drepanolobium ) have a mutually beneficial relationship with the local acacia ants ( Crematogaster sp.). The trees provide the ants with food and shelter and in turn the ants aggressively protect the trees from their biggest predator: hungry elephants. But the invasive ants, who live underground, slaughter the native species and feast on their eggs, larvae and pupae. So without the dissuasive stings of acacia ants on the whistling thorns, elephants are free to browse and break the trees up to seven times more in the invasive ants' territory. \"By controlling biophysical structure across landscapes, a tiny invader reconfigured predator-prey dynamics among iconic species,\" the researchers explain in their paper . This demonstrates how critical species interactions do not necessarily always involve the food chain. Other kinds of relationships between species, like the symbiotic mutualism between ants and trees can be just as significant. These interdependencies are more important to understand than ever, seeing as the many disturbances we humans are creating are rapidly unraveling complex systems of interactions that form a functioning ecosystem \u2013 from relocating invasive species to the mere sound of our voices everywhere. \"In an era characterized by rapid environmental change, such applied ecological research is critical to understand how disturbance alters ecosystem structure and function,\" says University of British Columbia zoologist Kaitlyn Gaynor in an accompanying commentary on the paper. \"Ultimately, the conservation of healthy ecosystems requires not only the prevention of species extinction but also the identification and preservation of the most important interactions among species.\" This research was published in Science Advances .",
        "summary": "Invasive big-headed ants ( Pheidole megacephala ) have hitched a ride with us from a Pacific island to many continents, including Africa. In the areas with less trees, lions ( Panthera leo ) had less cover from which to ambush zebras.",

Four months after approval of the entry by the FIA, the team\u2019s bid was rejected by F1 in a lengthy statement issued on Wednesday. The championship spelled out various reasons why it believed that the entry could not be accepted that went well beyond the commercial aspects that most observers expected F1 to cover. One of the key assertions was that F1 felt the team had bitten off more than it could chew by planning an entry for 2025 with a car built to the current regulations, and then be obliged to follow up by having to design another for the very different rules that come into force in 2026. F1 noted that \u201cwe do not believe there is a basis for any new applicant to be admitted in 2025 given that this would involve a novice entrant building two completely different cars in its first two years of existence. \u201cThe fact that the applicant proposes to do so gives us reason to question their understanding of the scope of the challenge involved.\u201d Andretti F1 Wind Tunnel Model in Toyota Cologne Photo by: Andretti Autosport Andretti had hitherto indicated that it was still ready to enter in 2025 if the timeline allowed it but the team confirmed on Friday that internally it had already switched its focus to a 2026 debut given the lengthy entry process.

In a statement the team said: \u201cWhen Andretti Cadillac entered the FIA expression of interest process almost a year ago, the preferred first year of participation was indicated as 2025. \u201cThe FIA approved our application, with no specific limitation on whether the entry was for 2025 or 2026. \u201cAndretti Cadillac has been operating with 2026 as the year of entry for many months now. \u201cThe technicality of 2025 still being part of the application is a result of the length of this process.\u201d In another apparently damning revelation, F1 said: \u201cHaving had the opportunity to consider the applicant\u2019s responses together with our own deliberations, we subsequently wrote to the applicant on 12 December 2023 extending an invitation to an in-person meeting at our offices in order for the applicant to present its application, but the applicant did not take us up on this offer.\u201d This claim appeared to question the willingness of the team to engage with F1, but Andretti Cadillac says that it did not know about the invitation.

(Adam Makarenko/WM Keck Observatory) Gas giant exoplanet WASP-69b has captured the attention of astronomers, this time because of the trail of gas it's leaving behind \u2013 a tail that's some seven times longer than the planet's radius. This tail is being created as the atmosphere of WASP-69b gets stripped away, making it a fascinating celestial object to study. Around the size of Jupiter , the planet is 160 light-years away from Earth, and sits unusually close to its star. That close proximity is the main reason for the elongated tail, according to the team behind the discovery, led by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA): the stellar wind radiation is blasting away the atmosphere of WASP-69b, and shaping the trail of gas behind it. \"Work by previous groups showed that this planet was losing some of its atmosphere and suggested a subtle tail or perhaps none at all,\" says astrophysicist Dakotah Tyler from UCLA. \"However, we have now definitively detected this tail and shown it to be at least seven times longer than the planet itself.\" An artist's illustration of a planet with a gas tail orbiting its star. (Adam Makarenko/WM Keck Observatory) The new insight was made possible through observations from a 10-meter telescope at the WM Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and readings from its high-resolution spectrograph \u2013 capable of precisely mapping changes in light wavelength and frequency. Through these fresh readings, the team was able to determine that WASP-69b was losing large amounts of hydrogen and helium , and could also study their interactions with the stellar wind in a high level of detail. Data gathered about WASP-69b will give astronomers invaluable information about how planets and stars interact \u2013 and we've caught this phenomenon at a crucial, early stage. \"For most known exoplanets, we suspect that the period of atmospheric loss concluded long ago,\" says astrophysicist Erik Petigura from UCLA. \"The WASP-69b system is a gem because we have a rare opportunity to study atmospheric mass-loss in real time and understand the critical physics that shape thousands of other planets.\" We've known about WASP-69b for over a decade, but as this latest study shows, there's still lots to discover. It's known as a hot Jupiter planet, one precariously close to its star, and it completes an orbit in less than four Earth days. There's no risk of the exoplanet running out of steam just yet though, even with its massive tail. It's such a giant planet that its star will be gone long before all of its atmosphere disappears into space . \"At around 90 times the mass of Earth, WASP-69b has such a large reservoir of material that even losing this enormous amount of mass won't affect it much over the course of its life,\" says Tyler. \"It's in no danger of losing its entire atmosphere within the star's lifetime.\" The research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal .",

        "body": "4 Out of 5 Autoimmune Patients Are Female: The X Chromosome Could Explain Why Health 03 February 2024 By Jess Cockerill (vchal/Getty Images) The immune system is meant to protect us from alien invaders like bacteria and parasites, and zombie-like takeovers by viruses and cancerous mutations. As grateful as we are for this protective system, for some it can get a little overzealous, becoming so hypervigilant it attacks its own body's tissues . With conditions like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis in its ranks, autoimmune disease is third most prevalent disease category, outstripped only by cancer and heart disease. Such immune system disorders also disproportionately affect women. In the US, four in every five autoimmune patients are women. New research has found this can be traced to an interaction between the two X chromosomes in people who've got a pair, predominantly cisgender women. When there's two X chromosomes available, a cell can only use the information from one, or things get a bit messy. To avoid double-ups on X-linked gene expression, one X chromosome is randomly 'silenced'. Long strands of RNA called Xist and their helper proteins wrap around the muted chromosome, preventing it from attempting any backseat driving. Because cells with XY chromosomes don't have that extra genetic material, they don't produce Xist at all. The new study, led by Stanford researchers, reveals that several of the proteins Xist recruits to help with chromosome silencing are autoantigenic. In autoimmune diseases, autoantigens are what trip the immune system's alarm, triggering it to attack the body it's meant to defend. The researchers showed this molecular complex is a major driver of autoimmunity, which may explain why women are more prone to developing these kinds of diseases. \"As a practicing physician, I see a lot of lupus and scleroderma patients, because those autoimmune disorders manifest in skin,\" says Stanford geneticist and dermatology expert Howard Chang . \"The great majority of these patients are women.\" Although this research was prompted by the concerning statistics for women, the findings may be relevant to anyone with two X chromosomes, including trans people and those with certain intersex conditions like Klinefelter syndrome, whose chromosomes are XXY. The researchers tested what happens when the Xist gene is inserted into two different strains of male mice \u2013 one strain that is susceptible to autoimmune symptoms similar to lupus, and the other strain resistant to it. This allowed them to examine how the immune system responds to Xist when there's only one X chromosome, while eliminating other factors that might be responsible for the high rates of autoimmunity among cis women, like female hormones or accidental protein production from a second X chromosome that was meant to be silenced. Usually, males from the susceptible strain of mice develop lupus-like autoimmunity at a much lower rate than their female counterparts. But when the inserted Xist gene was activated they began to develop the condition at a similar rate to susceptible females, and at a far higher rate than males who hadn't been engineered to produce the protein complex. Among the autoimmune resistant male mice, activating Xist wasn't enough for them to develop an autoimmune disease. In this strain, even females are far less prone. This suggests that while double X chromosomes place people at higher risk of developing autoimmunity, this is probably only the case if they have another existing genetic predisposition. While many people may be predisposed to an autoimmune disease, this experiment shows Xist proteins seem to increase the risk of the condition being 'turned on'. Chang notes these constraints on autoimmunity are fortunate, because otherwise all people with two X chromosomes might be more susceptible than those with just one. \"F or several decades, we've used a male cell line as the standard of reference,\" Chang says . \"That male cell line produced no Xist and no Xist/protein/DNA complexes, nor have other cells used since for the test. So, all of a female patient's anti-Xist-complex antibodies \u2013 a huge source of women's autoimmune susceptibility \u2013 go unseen.\" This research has been published in Cell.",

        "body": "We Finally Know What This Mysterious Ice Age 'Magic Wand' Was Used For Humans 03 February 2024 By Mike McRae Artifact found in Hohle Fels Cave in 2015. (Conard et al., Science Advances, 2024) Like the crooked finger of a fairy-tale witch, a fragmented ivory artifact recovered from an Ice Age dig site in southwest Germany several years ago almost wills to be pointed with sorcerous intent. Similar items have been discovered across the continent over the past century, all inviting speculation over the objects' purposes. Whittled into points, perforated with holes, thoughts have turned to wands and scepters. Or perhaps of flutes, or symbols of occult power. Instruments of ritual and magic. Nicholas Conard, an archeologist from the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany, and fellow archeologist Veerle Rots from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, are far more down-to-Earth in their thinking, suggesting on the baton's discovery that they were used to weave something other than spells. Now the two researchers have presented a proof-of-concept demonstration supporting their hypothesis. In 2015, Conard, Rots, and a team of fellow researchers uncovered 13 pieces of worked mammoth ivory from Hohle Fels Cave in the Ach Valley \u2013 a 40,000-year-old site of occupation already famed for the discovery of what is regarded as the oldest representation of a human figure . The ivory pieces fit together perfectly to form an object 20.4 centimeters (about 8 inches) in length, with four holes just wide enough to slip a pencil through. The worked ivory baton has no apparent purpose, at least not at first glance. Yet thanks to its exquisite state of preserved grooves, coupled with plant fibers sifted from the surrounding soil, Conard and Rots were confident it was a tool for making one of the Stone Age's most precious resources \u2013 rope. A) The ivory Lochstab, B-C) Plant tissues extracted from Lochstab, D-K) Grooves surrounding Lochstab's perforations. ( Conard et al., Science Advances , 2024 ) \"This tool answers the question of how rope was made in the Paleolithic, a question that has puzzled scientists for decades,\" Rots said in 2016 . While items of stone, antler, and ivory can persist across the millennia, less durable materials like plant fiber are lost to time. Yet rope, string, and thread would have been vital products in the Paleolithic, used to bind and secure everything from packaging to weapons to food to clothing. It's unthinkable that some kind of technology for making such material with ease wouldn't have existed. To further demonstrate the artifact, along with a second less well-preserved 'perforated baton' (or Lochstab in German) found downstream from the site at Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle Cave, were intended to make cordage, Conard and Rots reproduced a Lochstab of their own and put it to the test. It was clear from the start the baton wouldn't be practical or necessary for making thinner ropes and threads. Yet using the holes as a guide, thicker cords consisting of two to four strands could be twisted quickly and efficiently. The researchers tested various materials, including sinew from deer, hemp, flax, and nettles, finding cattail, linden, and willow fibers produced the best results. With four to five participants holding the Lochstab replica and feeding the strands, the researchers were able to weave 5 meters of quality cattail rope that was both robust and flexible in just 10 minutes. As with any replication, the experiment cannot prove beyond doubt that the artifacts served the same purpose, or were used in necessarily the same way. Just because an ancient artifact can be imaginatively used in a fashion doesn't mean it was, after all. Similar objects may also have subtly different uses, perhaps for holding shafts while projectile points are secured, or straightening lengths of wood. Coupled with microscopic analysis of the Hohle Fels Lochstab's grooves and plant fibers at the site, the puzzle of how high-quality ropes were produced thousands of years ago just might have its solution. This research was published in Science Advances .",

Suarez, the first Mexican-born Cup Series winner, is competing in the non-points NASCAR Mexico invitational event held prior to Sunday\u2019s Clash. Both series hit the temporary \u00bc-mile paved oval for the first time on Saturday. At a Fox Sports news conference Friday at the Coliseum, Suarez said the importance of the Mexico\u2019s series\u2019 involvement this weekend could not be understated. \u201cIf there was no NASCAR Mexico, there would be noDaniel Suarezin the Cup Series,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal. Some people understand that. Some people don\u2019t. But I do because I was part of that. \u201cThis series is being put on a very big stage.\u201d Daniel Suarez, Trackhouse Racing, Freeway.com Chevrolet Camaro Photo by: Matthew T. Thacker / NKP /Motorsport Images It\u2019s a stage the 32-year-old native of Monterrey, Mexico, is happy to share this weekend. Suarez, who debuted in NASCAR competition in Mexico in 2009 and became the first Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR national series race in 2016 with his Xfinity Series victory at Michigan, has become synonymous with NASCAR\u2019s diversity efforts in recent years. But he also never stops seeking to challenge himself and always wants to improve. After finishing a career-best 10th in the series standings in 2022 and winning his first Cup race, Suarez dropped 19th last year and failed to garner a win. Although only an exhibition, Suarez said he is anxious to get back behind the wheel of his No. 99 Chevrolet to start the new season, which also includes the addition of new crew chief Matt Swiderski, former competition director atKaulig Racing. \u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t check off a lot of goals (last year), I\u2019m extremely excited about the new year,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe did a lot of work on the No. 99 in the offseason as you guys saw and I\u2019m very excited to see where we\u2019re at. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything (too much) but I feel very good about it. I think all the work is going to pay off this year.\u201d Suarez said he has spent a lot of time with Swiderski since the crew chief change was announced. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working to understand each other. So far, I\u2019ve been nothing but impressed. I think Matt is a very, very talented crew chief.\u201d Suarez has made no secret of his affinity for the kind of organization team co-ownerJustin Markswas building when Suarez first arrived in 2021. In its relatively short tenure, three drivers \u2013 Suarez,Ross Chastainand Shane van Gisbergen \u2013 have won Cup races. Trackhouse recently added former Truck championZane Smithto its roster, who will compete in 2024 with Spire Motorsports. In addition, the organization has also entered Moto GP, fielding a two-rider team on Aprilia\u2019s RS-GP. With all the additions also come more expectations. \u201cThe company is growing and we\u2019re getting more and more hungry for victories and championships,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have people on teams that can perform and win races and not just once in a while. \u201cLast year we put ourselves in position (to win) a few times, but you won\u2019t be able to win a championship like that and you won\u2019t be able to win races on a consistent basis like that. If you want to win three to five races a year, there\u2019s no way. \u201cI thinkTrackhousedefinitely wants more, and we\u2019ve worked hard in the offseason to improve.\u201d",

        "body": "More And More Hermit Crabs Are Wearing Trash as a Home Instead of Shells Environment 03 February 2024 By Mark Briffa, The Conversation Hermit crabs are increasingly living in our trash instead of shells. (Shawn Mille, Science of the Total Environment, 2024) Land hermit crabs have been using bottle tops, parts of old light bulbs and broken glass bottles, instead of shells. New research by Polish researchers studied 386 images of hermit crabs occupying these artificial shells. The photos had been uploaded by users to online platforms, then analyzed by scientists using a research approach known as iEcology . Of the 386 photos, the vast majority, 326 cases, featured hermit crabs using plastic items as shelters. At first glance, this is a striking example of how human activities can alter the behavior of wild animals, and potentially the ways that populations and ecosystems function as a result. But there are lots of factors at play and, while it's easy to jump to conclusions, it's important to consider exactly what might be driving this particular change. Shell selection Hermit crabs are an excellent model organism to study because they behave in many different ways and those differences can be easily measured. Instead of continuously growing their own shell to protect their body, like a normal crab or a lobster would, they use empty shells left behind by dead snails. As they walk around, the shell protects their soft abdomen but whenever they are threatened they retract their whole body into the shell. Their shells act as portable shelters. Having a good enough shell is critical to an individual's survival so they acquire and upgrade their shells as they grow. They fight other hermit crabs for shells and assess any new shells that they might find for suitability. Primarily, they look for shells that are large enough to protect them, but their decision-making also takes into account the type of snail shell, its condition and even its color \u2013 a factor that could impact how conspicuous the crab might be. Another factor that constrains shell choice is the actual availability of suitable shells. For some as yet unknown reason, a proportion of land hermit crabs are choosing to occupy plastic items rather than natural shells, as highlighted by this latest study . (A) Artificial shells by hermit crabs. (B) Drivers of artificial shell use in hermit crabs and proposed tests. (Science of the Total Environment 2024) Housing crisis or ingenious new move? Humans have intentionally changed the behavior of animals for millennia, through the process of domestication . Any unintended behavioral changes in natural animal populations are potentially concerning, but how worried should we be about hermit crabs using plastic litter as shelter? The Polish research raises a number of questions. First, how prevalent is the adoption of plastic litter instead of shells? While 326 crabs using plastic seems like a lot, this is likely to be an underestimation of the raw number given that users are likely to encounter crabs only in accessible parts of the populations. Conversely, it seems probable that users could be biased towards uploading striking or unusual images, so the iEcology approach might produce an exaggerated impression of the proportion of individuals in a population opting for plastic over natural shells. We need structured field surveys to clarify this. Second, why are some individual crabs using plastic? One possibility is that they are forced to due to a lack of natural shells, but we can't test this hypothesis without more information on the demographics of local snail populations. Or perhaps the crabs prefer plastic or find it easier to locate, compared with real shells? As the authors point out, plastic might be lighter than the equivalent shells affording the same amount of protection but at lower energy cost of carrying them. Intriguingly, chemicals that leach out of plastic are known to attract marine hermit crabs by mimicking the odor of food . This leads to a third question about the possible downsides of using plastic. Compared to real shells plastic waste tends to be brighter and might contrast more with the background making the crabs more vulnerable to predators. Additionally, we know that exposure to microplastics and compounds that leach from plastic can change the behavior of hermit crabs, making them less fussy about the shells that they choose, less adept at fighting for shells and even changing their personalities by making them more prone to take risks . To answer these questions about the causes and consequences of hermit crabs using plastic waste in this way, we need to investigate their shell selection behavior through a series of laboratory experiments.

        "body": "'Sudden Death' Discovery Defies Our Understanding of Superconductivity Physics 03 February 2024 By Mike McRae (KTSDesign/Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Eddies of quantum chaos spontaneously emerging in atomically thin layers of insulating material have stumped physicists, requiring revisions to models that could solve some pressing problems in a quest to understand superconductivity . Experimental physicists from Princeton University in the US and the Japanese National Institute for Materials Science examined the spontaneous appearance of quantum fluctuations at a point of transition from electron traffic-jam to superconducting freeway cutting across a two-dimensional landscape. \"How a superconducting phase can be changed to another phase is an intriguing area of study,\" says Princeton physicist and senior author, Sanfeng Wu. \"And we have been interested in this problem in atomically thin, clean, and single crystalline materials for a while.\" The electrons drifting through the copper wiring behind your drywall have a hard time moving from A to B. Switch on your television, and peak-hour madness unfolds in those wires, with electrons swerving and bumping, tooting their tiny electron horns and shaking their tiny electron fists as their tiny electron engines overheat. Superconductivity is the dream . It's effortless motion from start to finish. No heat, no wasted energy. It's as efficient as efficient can be, perfect for generating powerful electromagnetic fields or high-speed computing that doesn't melt into a puddle. Yet it's also not exactly an easy phase of conductivity to produce. It occurs when electrons lose their sense of individuality and fall into sync, forming what's known as Cooper pairs , capable of negotiating the atomic neighborhood with zen-like ease. This demands a level of chill only achievable with some pretty impressive, heavy-duty equipment. Yet if researchers could understand precisely what triggers this quantum transition and the role temperature plays, they just might be able to make do with a little less cooling. One area of research involves examining the quantum behavior of electrons trapped on what are effectively 2D surfaces. Deprived of the ability to move up and down, quantum phenomena make their transition into a superconductive state a lot more challenging. \"As you go to lower dimensions, fluctuations become so strong that they 'kill' any possibility of superconductivity,\" says Princeton physicist Nai Phuan Ong. The primary killer of the electron's zen state is best described as a quantum vortex. Or as Ong describes it , \"quantum versions of the eddy seen when you drain a bathtub.\" According to what's known as the BKT transition , after Nobel laureates Vadim Berezinskii, John Kosterlitz, and David Thouless, these murderous whirlpools of doom vanish in 2D materials when the temperature sinks low enough. Investigating this space of quantum tornadoes playing havoc with superconductive states, Wu and his team crafted a single layer of the semi-metal tungsten ditelluride, which at anything warmer than a whisker above absolute zero is an energy-stifling insulator. Pumping in enough electrons, however, forces a current to flow in a superconducting manner. Yet the researchers noticed something quite bizarre when the temperature plummeted. Add enough electrons, you get superconductivity. At a critical level of electron traffic, though, those party-pooping whirlwinds of quantum madness return, switching off the current. Measuring the swirls revealed they weren't your average quantum vortices, remaining steady at higher temperatures and magnetic fields than theory dictates. When the number of electrons dips below a precise quantity, the vortices suddenly vanish. \"We expected to see strong fluctuations persist below the critical electron density on the non-superconducting side, just like the strong fluctuations seen well above the BKT transition temperature,\" says Wu. \"Yet, what we found was that the vortex signals 'suddenly' vanish the moment the critical electron density is crossed. And this was a shock. We can't explain at all this observation \u2013 the 'sudden death' of the fluctuations.\" New models introduce the possibilities of new avenues of research that just might lead to new technology. Given the potential rewards of developing room-temperature superconductivity, it helps to have a good map of the weather on the quantum landscape. This research was published in Nature Physics .",

        "title": "Research Shows One Easy Diet Swap Can Reduce Blood Pressure And Heart Attacks",

        "body": "Research Shows One Easy Diet Swap Can Reduce Blood Pressure And Heart Attacks Health 03 February 2024 By Xiaoyue Xu (Luna), Alta Schutte and Bruce Neal, The Conversation (Drbouz/E+/Getty Images) One in three Australian adults has high blood pressure (hypertension). Excess salt (sodium) increases the risk of high blood pressure so everyone with hypertension is advised to reduce salt in their diet. But despite decades of strong recommendations we have failed to get Australians to cut their intake. It's hard for people to change the way they cook, season their food differently, pick low-salt foods off the supermarket shelves and accept a less salty taste. Now there is a simple and effective solution: potassium-enriched salt. It can be used just like regular salt and most people don't notice any important difference in taste. Switching to potassium-enriched salt is feasible in a way that cutting salt intake is not. Our new research concludes clinical guidelines for hypertension should give patients clear recommendations to switch. What is potassium-enriched salt? Potassium-enriched salts replace some of the sodium chloride that makes up regular salt with potassium chloride. They're also called low-sodium salt, potassium salt, heart salt, mineral salt, or sodium-reduced salt. Potassium chloride looks the same as sodium chloride and tastes very similar. Potassium-enriched salt works to lower blood pressure not only because it reduces sodium intake but also because it increases potassium intake. Insufficient potassium, which mostly comes from fruit and vegetables, is another big cause of high blood pressure. What is the evidence? We have strong evidence from a randomized trial of 20,995 people that switching to potassium-enriched salt lowers blood pressure and reduces the risks of stroke, heart attacks and early death. The participants had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had high blood pressure. An overview of 21 other studies suggests much of the world's population could benefit from potassium-enriched salt. The World Health Organization 's 2023 global report on hypertension highlighted potassium-enriched salt as an \"affordable strategy\" to reduce blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular events such as strokes. What should clinical guidelines say? We teamed up with researchers from the United States, Australia, Japan, South Africa and India to review 32 clinical guidelines for managing high blood pressure across the world. Our findings are published today in the American Heart Association's journal, Hypertension. We found current guidelines don't give clear and consistent advice on using potassium-enriched salt. While many guidelines recommend increasing dietary potassium intake, and all refer to reducing sodium intake, only two guidelines \u2013 the Chinese and European \u2013 recommend using potassium-enriched salt. To help guidelines reflect the latest evidence, we suggested specific wording which could be adopted in Australia and around the world: Recommended wording for guidance about the use of potassium-enriched salt in clinical management guidelines. Why do so few people use it? Most people are unaware of how much salt they eat or the health issues it can cause. Few people know a simple switch to potassium-enriched salt can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of a stroke and heart disease. Limited availability is another challenge. Several Australian retailers stock potassium-enriched salt but there is usually only one brand available, and it is often on the bottom shelf or in a special food aisle. Potassium-enriched salts also cost more than regular salt, though it's still low cost compared to most other foods, and not as expensive as many fancy salts now available. A 2021 review found potassium-enriched salts were marketed in only 47 countries and those were mostly high-income countries. Prices ranged from the same as regular salt to almost 15 times greater. Even though generally more expensive, potassium-enriched salt has the potential to be highly cost effective for disease prevention. Preventing harm A frequently raised concern about using potassium-enriched salt is the risk of high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) in the approximately 2% of the population with serious kidney disease. People with serious kidney disease are already advised to avoid regular salt and to avoid foods high in potassium. No harm from potassium-enriched salt has been recorded in any trial done to date, but all studies were done in a clinical setting with specific guidance for people with kidney disease. Our current priority is to get people being managed for hypertension to use potassium-enriched salt because health-care providers can advise against its use in people at risk of hyperkalemia. In some countries, potassium-enriched salt is recommended to the entire community because the potential benefits are so large. A modelling study showed almost half a million strokes and heart attacks would ",
